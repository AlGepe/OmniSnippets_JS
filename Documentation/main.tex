\chapter{Before you start}

Dzien dobry lub dobry wiczor. Before we get to business, it's worth taking a look at what this \ttt{Primer} is and what it isn't, so that we don't waste your time.
This \textit{CustomJS primer} is meant as a quick-reference, or star-guide or user-manual for Calculatorians to first get started using Javascript in their calculators and later solve quick simple doubts that you might have while using that knowledge.

This is NOT a formal, technical, precise, dense, (hopefully) boring, all-encompassing\footnote{Thanks for the word Jack} Javascript book or written lecture on programming. This document aims to provide understandable, applicable knowledge and will sacrifice technicality and precision if needed. 

If you have any programming experience you will find the first sections of the second chapter to be extremely basic and you might prefer to start reading from the section \ref{}{}. If you already know how to program in Javascript, you might find most of it useless and some even probably offensive (if you style choices are worse than ours) so we recommend to just read those sections that relate to the application of such knowledge to making OmniCalculators such as REFSSS

Before we move on with the actual content let's faff around just a bit more and take a look at the different parts of this document and what to expect from them:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Chapter 1.- \textbf{Before you start} 
        \subitem Section 1.1 - A brief description of that is CustomJS what it does and how and when to use it
        \subitem Section 1.2 - Quick overview of the functions specific to omni that don't exist in regular JS
\subitem Section 1.3 - An \textit{Gepe-complete}\footnote{\textit{Gepe-complete} referes to the information that is fully complete to Al's eyes} start guide explaining the basic of general programming and the specifics of JS used at Omni
        \subitem Section 1.4 - A collection of \textit{rules} that we have in place at Omni and their reasons to exist
    \item Chapter 2.- \textbf{Okay so you are already coding...}
        \subitem Section 2.1 - Basic and advance use cases in Custom JS with strong focus on Omni functions
        \subitem Section 2.2 - How to prevent errors and what to do when they happen
        \subitem Section 2.3 - Style guide as agreed by most of Omni Calculatorians. Follow or be bullied.
