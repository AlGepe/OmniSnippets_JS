\subsection{Variables, functions, operations...}
    \subsubsection{Variables - Primitives}

\subsection{The laziness principle}

If it takes more than 5min to do think if someone might have done it before and look for it (or ask politely)
If you're doing the same thing more than 3 times, it can probably be automated. Never write the same thing (or almost the same thing) more than 5 times, there's surely a more efficient way\footnote{Exceptions might apply}
