From Calculatorian to Calculatorian (tips and tricks)
=====================================================

This is the fun and applicable section of the documentation, finally! 

In this section we will have a collection of tips, tricks, guidelines, common issues (and how to solve them)... Anything that we as calculatorians have find helpful and useful.

We will try to group every topic into one of three categories: **Problem solving, tips/tricks, and general advice/guidelines**. To keep it manageable and interesting for everyone, there will be a new topic published every week.

Problem solving
---------------

As the name implies, we have a collection of the most common problems that happen to all of us. We will explain (to some degree) why they happen, and how to solve and/or avoid them in the future. Feel free to suggest any new topic to be added to the list.

Tips and tricks
---------------

This section won't necessarily solve your problems but it will help you become a more advanced calculatorian while preventing problems from happening both now and in the future. This is the section that will help you personally and improve you customJS wizardry.

General advice and guidelines
-----------------------------

In an ideal world everyone's code will be bulletproof and future proof while being easily understandable at a glance. In the real world we all have different ideas of what that means and more important things to do. This is the wishful section in which we set standard practices that should make everyone else's life much better. This are not hard rules, nobody will be executed for not following them to the letter. However, following them will get us all a little bit closer to that ideal world we talked about before.
