From Calculatorian to Calculatorian (tips and tricks)
=====================================================

This is the fun and applicable section of the documentation, finally! 

In this section we will have a collection of tips, tricks, guidelines, common issues (and how to solve them)... Anything that we as calculatorians have find helpful and useful.

We will try to group every topic into one of three categories: **Problem solving, tips/tricks, and general advice/guidelines**. To keep it manageable and interesting for everyone, there will be a new topic published every week.

Problem solving
---------------

This section is meant to solve the problems you will find. You can expect to find here BB and customJS quirks, systematic approaches to finding/solving problems, how to minimize the damage when we make a mistake...

General advice and guidelines

This is the section dedicated to everyone else, including future-you. This is where we keep the company-wide guidelines and suggestions. This is the tedious work that no one likes to do, but everyone wishes the rest did. Please, try to follow it. :)
