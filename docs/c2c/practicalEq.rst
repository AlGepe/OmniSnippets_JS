Practical Problem Solving: Equations
====================================

We have already talked about the general rules for creating two-way self-solving calculators, you can read all about them in the sections aptly named :ref:`Equation editor - Part 1<equationEditor>` and :ref:`Equation editor - Part2<equationEditor2>`. There you can also find a simple example on how to get a system of equations solved for almost any combination of inputs.

However, when we encounter this problems in the real world, things tend to be more convoluted and the advice we presented in those pieces might not seem directly aplicable to your problem. So let's get that fixed. Let's now look at a real example [#f1]_ and how we can apply what we learnt to a Real Life situation
