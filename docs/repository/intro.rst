Repository and usage
====================

How to use it
-------------

Simply look for the behaviour you want, find the function that will give you the closer results. Once you have it copy and paste it in your customJS and use it like you would use any other function. Alternatively, you can modify it if you want a behaviour that is similar but slightly different to the one provided. For example, if you want to format your time using :ref:`sec2time<sec2time>` but you don't want to have milliseconds, simply remove that part of the ``return`` statement at the end.

It's always nice if you are thankful to whoever provided the function you used, from buying them a beer to a simple thank you, any kind of grateful behaviour is not obligatory, but highly encouraged.


How to contribute to the repo
-----------------------------

So you have created a function that you think other people will find useful, awesome! To add it to the repository you have 2 main options: DIY or get someone to do it for you. If you know how Github works and you want to submit your own function, feel free to do so. 

If you don't want to deal with all the hassle, that's fine too. Simply send the function to Alvaro or Dominik and they will make sure it gets added to the repository and to this section of the documentation. Credit will be properly given to whoever created, edited and/or submitted each function. Thank you very much to all of you!
