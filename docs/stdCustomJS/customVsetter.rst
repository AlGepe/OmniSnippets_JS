.. _customVsetter:
Custom vSetters (vSetter as vSelect)
====================================

Now we are going to see another use of the hiding/showing variable trick to improve functionality and give more control to the user without compromising functionlity.

And this is the perfect salespitch you should give to anyone asking about this trick. To us, calculatorians, this is just another standard trick in our arsenal. It simply hides a variable until a specific option is chosen in a value setter.

This allows to hide the true value of one or many variables under a collections
of presets (as a value setter) while still allowing the user to input any value
he would desire.

It looks like this when used in a calculator.
