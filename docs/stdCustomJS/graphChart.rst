Graphs and charts under calculator
==================================


.. seealso::
    We have created a calculator using this code so that you can see the results for yourself. Check it out at `Dynamic Graph <https://bb.omnicalculator.com/#/calculators/1953>`__ on BB

.. tip::
    If you are unsure about what type of chart suits your data better and people can't decide either, you can always set a value select to let the user decide.
