Omni's customJS technical documentation
=======================================

Welcome to the technical documentation of Omni's customJS. This is the only technical part of the guidel; I promise. It might be a bit more boring than normal, but it has been designed to be pretty much a translation of the old polish documentation found on `Daniel's gist <https://gist.github.com/trojanowski/1fd347f2b0cba5bd7ce3deb5fd3566af>`_. If you're looking for a user guide, code examples and tips and tricks for making your own customJS, we recommend you go to :ref:`Standard use of customJS<stdCJS>` or to :ref:`From Calculatorian to Calculatorian<c2c>`
