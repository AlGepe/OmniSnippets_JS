CustomJS is uncalled for
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Conveniently, Omni's *#first* calculator [#f1]_ (Simple Percentage), is the perfect example of a calculator that doesn't need customJS. It is a very simple calculator that most people will use to quickly calculate the value they need. In this case we want to keep calculators as **simple and easy to use** as possible. 

Another important reason why customJS is not a good addition is that the concepts calculated and shown are simple enough that they **don't require any visual aid**. There is no visualization that would greatly improve the usability or help with the explanations in the text. 

In cases like this, one should just **make a simple calculator**. To take the calculator to the next level, focus on making a **great text** that engages the reader [#f2]_ scores well on `SEO <https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1I2HJsbPei6VbLoTQ328CGBCF_AEb2RGy>`__. 

With all this said, **nothing is black or white**. A pie chart *could* help the user visualise what a given percentage means. Whether or not it is worth your time is something we don't a strict rule for. This is an example where we believe customJS is not worth your time, however for `Percentage Calculator <https://www.omnicalculator.com/all/percentage>`__ we thought it could be useful.
