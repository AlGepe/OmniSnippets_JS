CustomJS is uncalled for
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Example: `Simple Percentage <https://www.omnicalculator.com/all/percentage-app>`__

Conveniently, this example is actually Omni's #first ever calculator and shows clearly when CustomJS might be an unnecessary addition. This is a very simple calculator that most people will use to quickly calculate the value they need. In this case we want to keep calculators as simple and easy to use as possible. 

Another important reason why customJS is probably not a good addition is the fact that the concepts calculated and shown are simple enough that they don't require any visual aid, and there is also not clear visualization of the topics at hand that would greatly improve the usability or explanations that accompany the calculations. 

In cases like this, one should just make a simple calculator and focus on making a kick-ass text to go with it where the user can learn more about the topic. 

With all this said, is important to note that it is never cut-and-dry, a pie chart would help the user visualise what a given percentage means. It could be a decent addition depending on who visits the webpage, nevertheless we really think that in this particular case your time is be better invested elsewhere.
