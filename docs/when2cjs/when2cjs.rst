Should I use it?
----------------

We will now show you the functionalities that customJS provides and its (dis)advantages by looking at 4 different scenarios. One where customJS is not needed or useful, one where customJS is not needed but can add extra functionality (so customJS would be "desirable"), one where it is compulsory to use customJS, and finally marketing calculators. Marketing calculators require customJS but they are so different to regular calculator that they deserve their own section.
