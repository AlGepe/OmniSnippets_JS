Should I use it?
----------------

We will now show you the functionalities that customJS provides and its (dis)advantages by looking at 4 different scenarios. One where customJS is **not needed**, one where customJS **could be a good addition**, and one where it is **compulsory to use** customJS.

For those of you keep track, yes, we have only counted to three. The fourth scenario is **Marketing calculators**. Marketing calculators **require customJS** but they are so different to regular calculator that they deserve their own section.
