*Le* Marketing (surrender your freedom for a greater good)
----------------------------------------------------------

There are times in life when one needs must surrender its own needs and desires for a greater good. For calculatorians this time has been given the name of **Marketing Calculators** . And just as a good soldier must follow orders even against their own interest, a calculatorian must follow the guidance of the Marketing Team when the time comes. 

In all seriousness, though, marketing calculators are a special breeding for which many of the ordinary rules and guidelines bust be ignored or at least relegated to a secondary role. Marketing calculators have different goals than regular calculators and therefore their requirements are different. One of these differences is the fact that customJS is a must. 

In these instances customJs is not necessarily used to improve the functionality of the calculator but, mainly, for improving the user experience and fun-factor of the calculator, some times actively reducing the capabilities of the calculator since the main aim of it is not to solve a problem but to engage and entertain the user. 

There are countless examples of these calculators but have curated some of the (subjectively [#f12]_) best marketing calculators of all time:

#.  `Chilled drink Calculator <https://www.omnicalculator.com/all/chilled-drink>`__
#.  `Christmas Tree <https://www.omnicalculator.com/all/christmas-tree>`__
#.  `Exoplanet discovery Calculator <https://www.omnicalculator.com/all/exoplanet>`__

All these calculators tend to use customJs for some or all the reasons listed above, but also for reasons directly related to user experience. For example, the Chill Drink Calculator hides most of the technical variables behind user-selectable options that are easy to understand by laypeople. The Christmas tree calculator also does that and adds interactive graphics that help the user preview the results of the calculations. The exoplanet calculator is a perfect example of breaking almost every single rule about creating calculators heavily including html code to help the user understand and visualise the results.

.. rubric:: tl;dr

Calculators should be entertaining and simple, they should include customJS and EVERYTHING is overridden by whatever the Farhan, Reina or Natalia say at the time of building the calculator.
