CustomJS is desirable
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These calculators are also simple calculators that **don't require customJS** for them to work.

Taking the example of the Pythogorean Theorem Calcualtor we can see that a simple picture makes everything **much easier to understand**. You don't need to add help text to the variables and you can use the standard mathematical notation for each of the sides of the triangle. Which more comfortable and clear than using "First/Second Cathetus" and "Hypotenuse", which assume some pre-existing knowledge the user might not have.

A picture and some added text with the equation take this calculator **from "decent" to "very good"** and that's something we want to do as often as we can. 

This is by far the simplest example of customJS usage, but exemplifies very well the benefits of adding some customJS in the right places. Note that this calculator **does not need customJS** for its calculations, and neither do any of the examples.
