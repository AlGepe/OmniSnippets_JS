CustomJS is desirable
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Example: `Pythogorean Theorem <https://www.omnicalculator.com/math/pythagorean-theorem>`__
This is also a very simple calculator, that doesn't need to include customJS to be a decent calculator. 

However, a simple picture makes everything much easier to understand and simple to explain. You don't need to add help text to the variables and you can use the standard mathematical notation for each of the sides of the triangle. Which is a better approach than using "First/Second Cathetus" and "Hypotenuse" which assume some pre-existing. 

A picture and some added text with the equation take this calculator from "usable" or "decent" to "very good" and that's something we want to do as often as we can. 

This is by far the simplest example of customJS usage, but exemplifies very well the benefits of adding some customJS in the right places.  Some other, more complex but still useful additions of customJS can be seen here. Note that none of this calculators "require" the use of customJS but greatly benefit from it.
