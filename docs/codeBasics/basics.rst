================

This is the most introductory of introductory sections in this documentation. We will gloss over some of the terms and concepts that appear in programming. For the last time I warn you: if you already know anything about programming, this will be boring. Burt if you don't... then it will be a good starting points with lots of external links where you can learn as much as you want about coding and how it is done.

In this part we will talk about variables and other types of *information containers* [#f1]_. They are all basic elements of any programing language.

We have devided this containers into two different sections of increasing complexity:
