==========================================================================

Here we will have a short list of more iterative and execution control statements. These might or might not be ever useful for you, but if they do, you will consider them godsents. 

We will not describe them in detail here, instead opting for recommending you to google them or check the documentation.

The usefulness of this list is not so much as a detailed documentation or study material, but rather as a quick reference for those moments in which you feel like there should be a better way to do the same thing you're doing. So if you're feeling like that, please check this list to see if you can find what you're looking for.
