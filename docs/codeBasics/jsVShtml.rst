.. _jsHtml:
Javascript vs HTML
==================

Picture this: You are happily looking at someone's calculator looking for inspiration when **suddenly** weird characters appear on the screen and threaten you with their *"totally not javascript"* looks, or how you call it now: *syntax*. They probably look like this: ``<a href='http...'>something</a>``. **Fear not!** These are friendly characters that have been relegated to the darkest parts of BB, but that love showing up here and there to help you when you've already lost all hope or javascript is simply not having a good day [#f0]_. 

*HTMLs* are not the same breed as *Javascripts*. But they are the perfect companion for javascript and a loyal friend that help your javascript actually be used by people. Let me explain:

Javascript is similar to general purpose programming languages like Python, C or Java [#f1]_ and hence it is used to perform calculations, run algorithms and make webpages dynamic. On the other hand HTML is closer to markdown (what we use to write the text of the calculators) and it's main purpose is to display things and make them look pretty. When people talk about HTML they usually mention also CSS which is (for our level, anyway) kind of like a configuration file for HTML. It helps you define and organise :

**Compatibility** is also an important factor to take into account when using Javascript and HTML. HTML tends to be much more widely supported across all browsers (nothing is perfect, though), while Javascript can present significant compatibility concerns for those who program websites from the ground up, **so not us**. Luckily we have very nice and handsome developers [#f2]_ that deal with those problems for us and don't allow us to use incompatible functions. It can be a bit frustrating when making very complex calculators, but it ensures that **every visitor will get a very nice calculator that works as intended**.

.. rubric:: tl;dr

Javascript is for doing and HTML is for showing it to people.
Javascript is run by the computer of the user, and our server does the HTML

.. [#f1] It's similar but DEFINITELY different
