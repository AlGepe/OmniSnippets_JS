.. _lazy:
A programmer strives to be lazy (and you should, too)
=====================================================

As an employee you should try to do the most amount of work possible; as an individual you should try to do that with the least amount of effort; and as a colleague you should aim to make everyone else's job easier. Sound like too much? Doing it all perfectly probably is too much, but just knowing what you're aiming for should help you a great deal.

We have devoted a whole section to explaining what your mindset should be when coding, and it might seem like a waste of time better spent teaching some actual information... But that's just not true. The goal in this part is not to give you more information but to help you make better decision when coding. By knowing what things you should and shouldn't spend time on as well as what is and isn't possible in coding, you should be able to more efficiently work and seek new knowledge when needed without feeding you unnecessary information.

Ideally, when you're coding you should feel that thinking is free, effortless and fun, while actually writing code should be a chore, specially if you haven't thought about it before. We will dive deeper into this in the next section. As we have said at the beginning, you should aim to do the least amount of effort to get the most amount of work while making everyone's work easier. Here is where thinking really pays off. There are also a few tricks and *rules-of-thumb* that you should keep in mind when coding to avoid devoting more time into tasks that could be done easier and faster.

I hope I have lured you enough with the preamble, so let's dive right into it by taking a look at what your mindset should be and how to optimise your time when coding, even if you have no experience.

.. Talk about why it is important to have this mindset (knowing how to vs knowing it's possible)

The coding mindset
------------------

First thing we will try to do here is to decode the programmer mindset for you. The most basic way to convey what your mindset should be is: be lazy, don't be sloppy. Here we will focus on how to be lazy and what being lazy means for a programmer. The gist of it is that you should never do more work than you absolutely need to, you should not do work you are not good at, and you should plan before you write your code.

We have divided this section in to 3 parts to tackle the most important points that define this **mindset**. From first to last, each part will teach you what you *SHOULDN'T DO* what you *SHOULD DO* and how to balance the aim for perfection with the need to actually produce some results.

Don't try to be a computer, play to your strengths
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The most important thing you should realise as a programmer is what kind of work you should be doing and what kind of work should be done by the computer. Computers are very very good at doing simple tasks many times and very fast. Don't try to compete with them in that, they'll crash you. Instead, you should focus on taking advantage of your one true advantage over a computer: abstract thinking.

In short, if you find yourself doing the same thing (or very similar tasks) more than 5 times, **STOP!** Take a deep breath and think how this task could be automated, re-written or substituted by something else so that you **don't actually spend your time doing computer-work**. As a side effect of this, even if it takes you the same amount of time, your code will be much cleaner, easier to understand and elegant.

Your strengths, spend time doing this
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. Breaking down the problem into smaller and smaller parts => plan so you don't rewrite

Time learning vs time doing, what to do when
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. Hacks/quick fixes, when and when not

.. When to learn, when to get help and when to just get it done



Lazy code vs sloppy code
------------------------

As a Spanish person I feel perfectly qualified to talk about laziness. And as a Spaniard with a job, I feel qualify teach you the way to success through laziness.

In all seriousness, thought, it is important that we distinguish between being lazy and being ineffective or inefficient. We have talked about the advantages of being *"lazy"* and what it means. So we will talk now about the things you should avoid to do in the name of laziness so that you future self and all your colleagues will thank you for it.
