.. _lazy:

A programmer strives to be lazy (and you should, too)
=====================================================

As an employee you should try to do the most amount of work possible; as an individual you should try to do that with the least amount of effort; and as a colleague you should aim to make everyone else's job easier. Sound like too much? Doing it all perfectly probably is too much, but just knowing what you're aiming for should help you a great deal.

.. Talk about why it is important to have this mindset (knowing how to vs knowing it's possible)

The coding mindset

Lazy code vs sloppy code
------------------------

As a Spanish person I feel perfectly qualified to talk about laziness. And as a Spaniard with a job, I feel qualify teach you the way to success through laziness.

In all seriousness, thought, it is important that we distinguish between being lazy and being ineffective or inefficient. We have talked about the advantages of being *"lazy"* and what it means. So we will talk now about the things you should avoid to do in the name of laziness so that you future self and all your colleagues will thank you for it.
