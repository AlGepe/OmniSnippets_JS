To simplify the process of creating and editing a calculator in customJS, Omni provides a set of personalized instructions that act as a translation between the pure javascript and the calculatorian. 

In this section we will take a look at all of them from a technical point of view. For each element we will see its behaviour, its syntax and the input and output parameters required. 

If you are looking for a practical explanation and practical usage guide, head to the section :ref:`STD usage of customJS<stdCJS>` were we will take a look at how to achieve the desired behaviour in our calculator by using and combining the different elements available.
