.. _lineChart:
How to create a line chart
==========================

We are now going to take a look at how to create a ``line`` chart, but this time we will not use statically created values like in the section :ref:`addChart<addChart>`.

When making a calculator the data normally has to be... calculated (surprising, right?) based on the input given by the user. Behind this calculation there is always a **function that depends on some parameters**, normally it's either *x* or *time*, but could be anything.

To create the data we will use a ``for`` loop and we will use the method ``push`` which **adds a new entry at the end of an array**. Our '*entry*' represents a point and is an array with the values we want to display.

Practical example
-----------------

We first define the example function: ``f(x) = x‚Åø + offset``. We will display the data from ``x = a`` to ``x = b``. The user will input two different values for ``n`` and ``offset`` giving us the chance to show several datasets in one graph.

Our goal here is to create a line chart that will show two different functions together. The user will define ``n`` and ``offset`` for each of our functions.

   Example of a line chart with two user defined functions

We have chosen the following colours for this chart: **red** (for ``n1`` and ``offset1``) and **yellow2** (for ``n2`` and ``offset2``) which corresponds to positions **10** and **7** in the array of data [#f1]_ as shown in the :ref:`color coding in charts<colorChart>` picture we showed in a previous section.

    We have created a calculator using this code so that you can see the results for yourself. Check it out at `Charts (line) <https://bb.omnicalculator.com/#/calculators/1967>`__ on BB.

Code and comments
-----------------

Let's look that the example code now:

.. code-block:: javascript
    :linenos:
    :emphasize-lines: 13-18, 20, 21

    'use strict';

    omni.onResult(['a','b','offset1','n1','n2','offset2'], function(ctx){

        var chartData = [],
            n1 = ctx.getNumberValue('n1'),
            n2 = ctx.getNumberValue('n2'),
            offset1 = ctx.getNumberValue('offset1'),
            offset2 = ctx.getNumberValue('offset2'),
            a = ctx.getNumberValue('a'),
            b = ctx.getNumberValue('b');

        for (var i = a; i <= b; i++){
            chartData.push([mathjs.format(i, 2), // x-value
                            ,,,,,,              // blank data to match colors
                            mathjs.pow(i, n2) + offset2, // yellow2 y-value
                            ,,                 // black data to match color
                            mathjs.pow(i, n1) + offset1 // red y-value
                           ]);
        }
        ctx.addChart({type: 'line',
                    labels: ['x',,,,,,, 'y2',,, 'y1'],
                    data: chartData,
                    title: "Chart",
                    afterVariable: "",
                    alwaysShown: false
                    });
    });


You can see here that the data is created inside a *for* loop in lines 13-18. Pay attention also to the **empty spaces between data** that allow us to get exactly the colour we want. 

.. warning::
    The position of the labels need to match the position of the data in the array, otherwise the data will not be shown.

There is little to not difference between making a basic ``line`` chart and making a ``bar`` or ``area`` chart. We have purposely not activated the option to *stack* the data as this option is very prone to errors.

.. tip::
    For cleaner code that is easy to understand consider using functions when performing complex operations inside the *for* loop. You might also want to look up the :ref:`Advanced uses of arrays<advArray>` section or the `map method <https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_map.asp>`__.

.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#f1] The first position in an array is the position "**0**" (zero) and corresponds to the x-value.
