*Le* Marketing (surrender your freedom for a greater good)
----------------------------------------------------------

There are times in life when one must surrender its own needs and desires for a greater good. For calculatorians this time has been given the name of **Marketing Calculators**. And just as a good soldier must follow orders even against their own interest, calculatorians must follow the guidance of the Marketing Team when the time comes. 

In all seriousness, though, marketing calculators are a special breed of calculators. Marketing calculators have different goals than regular calculators and therefore the **regular rules and guidelines don't really apply** here.

In marketing calculators customJS is mostly used for **improving the user experience and fun-factor** of the calculator. Occasionally it might even reduce the capabilities of the calculator since the main aim of it is not to solve a problem but to engage and entertain the user. 

There are countless examples of these calculators but have curated some of the (subjectively [#f12]_) best marketing calculators of all time:

#.  `Chilled Drink Calculator <https://www.omnicalculator.com/all/chilled-drink>`__
#.  `Christmas Tree Calculator <https://www.omnicalculator.com/all/christmas-tree>`__
#.  `Exoplanet Discovery Calculator <https://www.omnicalculator.com/all/exoplanet>`__

This calculators exemplify the main features you want to get from customJS. The *Chill Drink Calculator* **hides most of the technical variables** behind user-selectable options that are easy to understand by laypeople. The *Christmas Tree Calculator* does that and adds **interactive graphics** that help the user preview the results. The *Exoplanet Discovery Calculator* is a perfect example of **breaking almost every single rule** about creating calculators heavily including html code, showing multiple non-fundamental fields to the user and also giving them advance controls.

.. rubric:: tl;dr

Marketing calculators should be entertaining and simple to use. They should include customJS and *EVERYTHING* is overridden by whatever the Farhan, Reina or Natalia say at the time of building the calculator.
