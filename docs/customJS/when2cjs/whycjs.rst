Why do we use customJS more and more
------------------------------------

In the beginning there was Mateusz. He started making calculators at speeds never known to humankind before. But he couldn't make them perfect for he was only (partially) human. This meant **prioritizing speed and throughput** over quality and visuals. This was good in the **pre-calculatorian times** at Omni.

However, with time, Omni started to produce a rare breed of humans, humans with the ability of empowering other humans to calculate anything and, impossible as it seemed at the time, do so while having fun. These **highly evolved calculatorians** grew in size quickly allowing for priorities to be shifted from throughput to quality; Omni didn't need to just exist, it **needed to be awesome**, the best.

You see, when Omni was created customJS was nothing more than a time saver, a workaround, an 'unlocking' feature. However, with the advent of the calculatorians-age customJS is being **more and more widely use in calculators**. The result is more beautiful calculators, more user friendly tools and overall better quality Omni-calculators. 

It is for this reason that **writting customJS** has gone from a dark art to a truly **useful skill** that every calculatorian should know. From adding images, to making interactive calculators that show/hide variables depending on the user input, to graphs or even having different calculators in one, customJS can take your **calculator from good to awesome**!

That said, you **shouldn't use customJS just for the sake of it**. Omni calculators have to be as simple and easy to use as possible (without compromising functionality). Some times it is better to stick to the standard procedure and **not sacrifice user experience**. 

To assess better if your calculator could benefit from some customJS goodness, the best way is to look at some examples and **understand what is possible, what is recommended and what is not** recommended; so let's do that!
