A quick guide on customJS use cases
===================================

Let’s start with the basics, customJS is one of the many **options available for calculatorians** when making a calculator. The customJS tab consists of a text window where you can write your own (custom) javascript (JS) code to be executed when the calculator is loaded and during subsequent calculations. As a calculatorian you can chose to run plain Javascript code (though it’s functionality is capped) or use some of the **omni functions that are at your disposal**. The available `Omni functions` help you interact with the elements of the calculator as well as to run commands at different moments in the loading-calculating process.

In this section we will take a look at **when and why we use customJS** in our calculators. We will not explain how to this, that is reserved for other sections where we will take a look at the :ref:`Technical documentation of custom functions<omni>`, :ref:`Standard practices in customJS<stdCJS>`, :ref:`Tips and Tricks<c2c>` from other calculatorians.
