Ideas for marketing calculators
===============================

There are two places where you can post ideas for marketing calculators:

1. :ref:`#hot-topic channel <slack>` - Here we post the ideas that can't wait. So it's a hot topic, hitting the news right now, and we can't wait a week or two to create the calculator.
 
   - The idea **don’t need to be fully defined** — e.g., [link] + short description: scientists found the new way of creating coffee, maybe we can calculate something here.
   - We will only discuss and give feedback on **chosen ideas / articles / news**. If you know something about this topic, or notice something everyone else has overlooked, feel free to chime in.
   - If the idea is accepted, we'll try to create the tool **as soon as possible**.
 
2. **Brainstorm tab** in the mastermind spreadsheet — here come all the ideas for marketing calculators that can wait.
 
   - The idea should be **well-defined**, and as precise as possible (there are some additional questions in the Brainstorm tab that will help you).
   - The marketing team will discuss the tools and **give feedback** ~once per 2 weeks.
   - If the idea is approved, the idea can wait e.g. a week but also many months (e.g. until it's the right time to promote).
