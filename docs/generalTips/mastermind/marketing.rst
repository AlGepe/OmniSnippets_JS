Marketing calculators
=====================

There are two places where you can post the ideas for marketing calculators:

1. `#hot-topic channel <slack>` - here we post the ideas that can't wait. So it's a hot topic, hitting the news right now, and we can't wait a week or two to create the calculator.
 - The idea **don’t need to be fully defined** - e.g. [link] + short description: the scientists found the new way of creating coffee, maybe we can calculate something here.
 - We will discuss and give feedback only for **chosen ideas / articles / news**, as we imagine it may look as Omni news-feed, a constant flow of information.
 - If the idea is accepted, we’re trying to create the tool **as soon as possible**.
 
2. **Brainstorm tab** in the mastermind spreadsheet - here come all the ideas for marketing calculators that can wait.
 - The idea should be **well-defined**, and as precise as possible (there are some additional questions in the Brainstorm tab that will help you)
 - The marketing team will discuss on tools and **give feedback** ~once per 2 weeks
 - If the idea is approved, the idea may wait e.g. a week but also many months (e.g. till it's the right time to promote)
