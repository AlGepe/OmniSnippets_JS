How to use mastermind worksheet?
=====================

The mastermind worksheet consists of eleven columns:

1. **Calculator name** - it's preferably the name with the highest traffic.
2. **Category** - it's one of fourteen categories we currently have at Omni Calculator.
3. **Semrush** - it's the volume of the *Calculator name* phrase in the :ref:`SEMrush <semrushDashboard>` keyword research tool. In other words, it say how often do people search for that phrase in Google.
4. **Semrush (without the word "calculator")** - that should be self-explanatory. We use it to check how popular is the calculator's topic.
5. **Example of the calculator (link)** - it's usually the link to the first calculator in Google results. It should reflect what are most likely people expecting from the calculator.
6. **Comments** - it contains additional comments to the idea ranging from alternative keywords and more calculators examples up to reference to already existing calculators (to clone and modify) or user requests. Be sure to always check it closely, since it often contains long but important information.
7. **Author 1** - this a place where you can **type in your name** to reserve the calculator for yourself. Before you do it, make sure this calculator is not already created or in progress by checking the `adminBB calculators list <calculators>`. We don't want to create the same calculator twice!
8. **Author 2 (opt.)** - if you create a calculator with another person, this is a place to mention it.
9. **Published?**
