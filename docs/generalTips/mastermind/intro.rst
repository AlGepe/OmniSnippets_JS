Mastermind
=================================================

The *Calculator Mastermind* spreadsheet serves as a planning tool that **gathers ideas** for the standard and marketing calculators. You can find it in :ref:`Omni Common <omniLinks>` Google drive. Three of the tabs are especially interesting for calculatorians:

1. **Mastermind** - this is a list of calculators we want to create or we have already created. The Masterminders team updates it with new ideas from time to time. This worksheet is moderated by Dominik, so if you have any feedback or there is a lack of available calculators from your category, he is the right person to contact.  
2. **Brainstorm** - this worksheet is devoted to ideas for :ref:`marketing calculators <marketingCalculators>`. The marketing team reviews all the new ideas and decides whether we want to create them, reject them, or the topic requires additional research and discussion.
3. **<idea graveyard>** - this is a sad list containing marketing ideas we have discarded for some reason.
