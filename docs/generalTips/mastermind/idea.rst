How to add an idea?
===================

The new ideas are not always doable or worth doing at Omni Calculator. For that reason, they should be **added by the Mastermind team** (currently Hania, Dominik and Steve), other experienced people, or after you've been instructed to add an idea. If you have any ideas for calculators, contact one of the Masterminders and describe your idea, along with: **name, SEMrush traffic, and a link to an example**. But, before you do it, check the following points:

1. Is this idea already on the **Mastermind spreadsheet**? (remember to turn off filters)
2. Do we already have this calculator **published**?
3. Do we have **similar** calculators? We sometimes want to create practically the same calculator but with a different name if there is SEO potential, but that's not always the case.
4. Do we use this calculator's name as a **keyword** in another calculator? It might be more tricky to check. There are two ways to do it: use the :ref:`search bar <searchBar>` on the calculator's page or try to add this keyword to a dummy (temporary) calculator. If the keyword is already in use, then you will see an error.
5. Does the calculator require **features we don't have**?
6. Can the calculator **compete with other sites**?

Of course, this list isn't strict. If you feel your idea might be worth creating, ask a Masterminder (currently Hania, Dominik and Steve), who will help you decide.
