A Guide for reviewers
=====================

The goal of reviewing a calculator is to make sure it gives the user the correct answer in a user-friendly way while being attractive to Google search.

Our calculators should be simple enough to use without reference to the text (on mobile especially, it takes effort to find detailed instructions). If it is not obvious from the variable labels what the user needs to do, maybe some instruction added to the calculator would help, along with variable help text.

Here's what this guide covers:
