Making changes yourself
=======================

If the Calculatorian is **relatively new** (less than 10 published calculators), you should point out issues with the calculator and let them make the change themselves. This will enhance their learning of what is expected of a good calculator. Given this, you will find your review comment is long at first but should get shorter with time.

For more **experienced Calculatorians** and where only small changes are required, you can go ahead and make these yourself. Think whether writing out the comment is going to take longer than fixing it yourself. If you notice a Calculatorian is making the same mistake in all their calculators, then raise the issue and teach them the correct way to do something.

If you have made small changes, you can say briefly what you've done. For fine details of changes, you can provide a :ref:`link to the diff<revisionsDdIcon>` between the author's last revision and yours.
