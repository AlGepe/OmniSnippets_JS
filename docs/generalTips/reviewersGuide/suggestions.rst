Suggesting design changes
=========================

Could the calculator do with additional features needed by the user or provided by our competition? However, when thinking of suggesting design changes to the calculator, you should lean towards making the calculator **as simple as it can be** for the user.

When considering additional features, think about how valuable they might be to the user. Does it save them any extra calculations? Is an extra output focused on the subject of the calculator?
