Asking for help
===============

If you are not completely sure of something, the best thing to do is ask in the special yyy_reviewing Slack channel. The collective wisdom of the reviewers and proofreaders will certainly be able to help you. There you will find:

* Reviewers;
* Proofreaders;
* Hania – general calculator questions;
* Bogna – SEO questions; and
* Maciek – product questions.
