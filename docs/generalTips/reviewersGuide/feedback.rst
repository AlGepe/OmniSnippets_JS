Constructive feedback
=====================

Reviewing a calculator is not about telling somebody off for doing something wrong. It should all be about **growth and learning**. Your job is not only to make the current calculator you are reviewing the best it can be but also future calculators that Calculatorian creates. So be nice and teach them to make perfect calculators. The more a Calculatorian learns, the less work for you in the future üòÅ

An excellent way to give feedback is to **ask questions** of the author. Have you considered this? Did you account for that? Get them to question aspects of their calculator so they may realize the issue themselves and fix it.

Format of a review comment
--------------------------

Start with a brief overview of your thoughts on the calculator ‚Äì stay positive ‚Äì what did you like best?

When it comes to critical comments the author needs to address, separate the comment into a calculator section and a text section, and number each comment. Like this:

Calculator:

  1. First issue
  2. Second issue

Text:

  1. First comment
  2. Second comment

Numbering your comments makes it easy for the author to either say, "OK that's been addressed", or "I don't agree and here's why".
