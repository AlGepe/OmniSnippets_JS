Trello card checklists
======================

The most basic requirements we make of a calculator are covered in the detailed checklist on each calculator Trello card. If the author has checked an item, then it should have been done. You **should not** consciously go through each item of the checklist to verify if they are done, but you should know all these rules and internalized them.

However, if you notice that a checklist item has not been done correctly, you can simply call it out to the author by saying, "Check this again", and paste the item into your response. If the correction is still not right, guide them some more with a constructive comment (you could also do this on the first review if the author is relatively new to Omni).
