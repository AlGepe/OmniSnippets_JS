Search engine optimization
==========================

Check with SEMrush to see if any **obvious keywords with good traffic** are missing from the calculator keyword list. You shouldn't spend too long checking. We don't want you repeating the keyword search already performed by the author.

If you know we have a calculator that would be good to link to, go ahead and add it (though remember that a new calculator can only have a maximum of **five links**. Let the author know in your comment.

All of the keywords don't have to get a green SEO rating, but make sure most of them do. If the SEO tab is not all green, see if you can advise the author of a way to get a perfect score in that tab. Sometimes, though it might not be possible.

For any missing keywords, look at the text to see if our SEC scorer has missed it.

Consider the FAQs and whether they follow the current :ref:`FAQ guidelines<faqGuide>`.
