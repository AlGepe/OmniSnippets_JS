Calculator and text style
=========================

Most of the style guidelines for the calculator and text can be found in the following places within this Handbook:

* :ref:`Calculator style guide<calcStylingGuide>`
* :ref:`Text styling guide<textStylingGuide>`

Ease of use
-----------

Consider whether a user coming to the calculator for the first time can quickly work out what it does and how to use it. Think about the following points:

* Are variables in a **logic order** (e.g., common inputs at the top, outputs at the bottom)?
* Are the variable labels good descriptors of each value?
* Should some variables have **default values**? Examples are variables that usually have a standard value, but sometimes the user might like to change it (e.g., acceleration due to gravity). On the other hand, we don't want too many default values, so there is nothing for the user to do.
* Is the range of units available to the user sensible for what's being calculated? Are the default units the commonest ones used?
* Would a variable benefit from some **help text**?
* To quickly inform the user how to use the calculator, would a brief bit of text at the top help?
* If there are many variables, are they organized into **logic groups** that help the user navigate the calculator?
* Does it make sense to **auto save** the variable? These are usually personal data items, such as age, height, etc. This saves time for the user when they come back to the user.

Text contents
-------------

As well as introducing the topic, the text should include how to use the calculator, what equations are used (if not too complicated to explain), and an example of how you would calculate a result by hand or using the calculator. It should make logical sense as you read through it. Does it match up with our :ref:`text styling guidelines<textStylingGuide>`?

It should also contain the all-important FAQs that should conform to the current :ref:`FAQ guidelines<faqGuide>`.
