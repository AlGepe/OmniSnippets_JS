Pictures
=====================

Due to performance issues, we try to keep our images as light as possible. We set our **upper limit to 100 KB for a single illustration**.

Before resizing, check the following sites to download and edit images:

* `pexels.com <https://www.pexels.com/>`_ and `unsplash.com <https://unsplash.com/>`_ — Databases with free pictures;
* `tinyjpg.com <https://tinyjpg.com/>`_ — Reducing the image size.

.. note::
  If the image is in **jpg** or **png** format, you should **always** put it through `tinyjpg.com <https://tinyjpg.com/>`_ **, even if its size is already below 100 KB**.

How to resize an image?
-----------------------

Here we present **one** of the possible ways to change the illustration size. To resize pictures, you'll need:

* **paint.NET** (desktop application for Windows). You can download it `here <https://www.getpaint.net/>`_.
* **tinyjpg.com** (web application).

.. note::
  Feel free to use any other image-editing software you're comfortable with. Treat this instruction as an example of what you should pay attention to. 
 
Repeat these steps for every image:
 
1. **Download the selected image** from the Internet.
2. **Open	the image** in *paint.NET*. You can simply drag and drop it into the workspace.

    :align: center

    
3. **Resize the image**. Set the image **width to 1000 pixels** (if the image is smaller, no need). The height will resize automatically. Click the *OK* button.

4. Set the **file type** and **saving location**.

    :alt: Saving an image in paint.NET.
    :align: center
    
Use **JPEG format** and **name the image appropriately**. If the image is not as detailed as a photo (chart, table, etc.), PNG might be a better saving format. Click *Save*.

5. Set the **image quality**.

.. _picturesQuality:
.. figure:: pictures_quality.png
    :scale: 50 %
    :alt: Setting an image quality in paint.NET.
    :align: center
    
In the boxes you can see **quality level** (``0-100``) and **predicted file size**. We suggest that you **set the quality around 50-60** → this image quality is still good and its size is acceptable. If this image quality produces an unintelligable image, select a higher value. **Remember to not exceed 100 KB in image size** (200 KB is the absolute limit in extreme cases).

6. Open `tinyjpg.com <https://tinyjpg.com/>`_ and **upload the resized image**.

.. _picturesUpload:
.. figure:: pictures_upload.png
    :scale: 50 %
    :alt: Uploading an image quality to tinyjpg.com.
    :align: center
    
You can simply drag and drop the image or load it from a folder. tiny.jpg will drop the image size again (by deleting the metadata, etc.).

7. **Download the resized image**.

.. _picturesDownload:
.. figure:: pictures_download.png
    :scale: 50 %
    :alt: Downloading a resized image from tinyjpg.com.
    :align: center

You can see that this removed part of the image size.


Now, the image is ready for :ref:`uploading via Omni FTP <textEditorPicturesUpload>`!
