Default values
==============

Sometimes, you believe that one of the value select's options is most likely.
This belief can be based on the most popular/probable option, or on data you know / can safely assume about the user.
Alternatively, perhaps you want to push the user for that option.
In all of these cases, you can set a default value for the value select variable, which will be its initial state.
