.. _uxVariableBlockMonetary:

Monetary
========

The monetary setting enables a specific rounding policy and visualization on a variable block to represent monetary values (e.g. $12.50).
Specifically, :ref:`rounding <uxVariableBlockRounding>` is set to two decimal places and the :ref:`number of minimum decimal digits <uxVariableBlockMinimumDecimalDigits>` is set to two.

How to use it well
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Use it consistently across the calculator. If one variable uses monetary type, all other variables associated with money amounts should use the monetary type as well.

* If the tool is specific to a given currency (such as the `US loan forgiveness calculator <https://www.omnicalculator.com/finance/student-loan-forgiveness>`_), force the desired currency symbol by adding it as a prefix to the variable.

* **NEVER mix the prefix and the monetary setting**.
