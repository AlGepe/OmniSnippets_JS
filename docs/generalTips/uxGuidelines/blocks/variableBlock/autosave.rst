.. _uxVariableBlockAutosave:

Autosave by default
===================

Values entered into such variables should be stored, so that when the user returns for their next session, this variable can be pre-populated.
You can specify the default behavior using the "Autosave by default" option where appropriate.
The user can later toggle this behavior on or off.

When to use it
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When an input value is inherent to the user and does not change frequently (such as height, age, income, and more).
