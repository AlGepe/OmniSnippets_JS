Image blocks
============

*(page under construction as image blocks may change in the near-ish future)*

Image blocks are content blocks that can show one or more images at a time.
Images make great content, and are extremely useful for many types of tools.

How to use it well
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* **DO** use images to give explanations to the users regarding the tool's calculations.  Consider geometry calculators, or the diagram of a joint in a carpentry tool.

* **DO** use images to add some material to the results.  If a number is not enough to tell our user a story, an image could help.

* **DO** use images to add explanatory content, such as a picture of a Gentoo penguin below a value select containing the species.

* **DON'T** overuse this --- the image must add value to the calculator, clarifying something words and numbers can't.

* **DON'T** allow images to push other more valuable content too far down the calculator.  Important content goes at the top of the calculator, and images are less important than variable input fields.
