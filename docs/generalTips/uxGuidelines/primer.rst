What is UX?
-----------

In a broad context, UX (or "user experience") is the combination of all aspects of a user's interaction with a product, specifically those aspects relating to satisfaction and ease of use.
UX also refers to the multi-disciplinary methodology of improving such interactions.

In the more specific context of interactive online widgets such as Omni's calculators, UX involves designing calculators for maximum usability, intuitive interaction, and efficiency in user inputs and calculations.
The end goal is to deliver an overall enjoyable experience that will lead to engagement with the calculator and website.

What this guide is
------------------

This chapter of the handbook covers best practices of V2's features so that we maximize the UX of our calculators.
It aims to lay out a set of principles and guidelines for making a calculator as “good” as possible --- one that (1) helps achieve user goals, (2) feels natural to people, (3) works as expected, and (4) requires minimum effort to use.

What this guide is not
----------------------

This chapter will not cover instructions on how to use the V2 features in the AdminBB interface --- for that, visit the :ref:`Edit calculator (Engine v2) section <editCalculatorV2>`.

This chapter will also not cover the guidelines and steps for migration of V1 calculators to V2 (although you should apply the UX principles from this guide during migration).
Instead, please visit the :ref:`Migration section <migration>`.
