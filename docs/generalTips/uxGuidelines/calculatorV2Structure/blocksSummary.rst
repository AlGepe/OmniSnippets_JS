Blocks (summary)
================

*This page is a summary of how blocks fit into a calculator's hierarchy. For UX guidelines on blocks, visit the links in the list of block types below.*

Blocks are the smallest, most atomic part of a calculator (see :ref:`a V2 calculator's structure<uxV2Structure>`).
They represent single individual entities to the user --- variable input fields, images, blocks of text, etc.

There are currently three types of blocks [TODO link to each]

* :ref:`Variable blocks <uxVariableBlock>`
* :ref:`Text blocks <uxTextBlock>`
* :ref:`Image blocks <uxImageBlock>`
