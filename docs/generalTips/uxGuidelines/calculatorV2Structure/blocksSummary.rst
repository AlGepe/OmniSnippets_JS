Blocks (summary)
================

*This page is a summary of how blocks fit into a calculator's hierarchy.
Follow the links in the list of block types below for UX guidelines for each block.*

Blocks are children elements of :ref:`columns <uxMatricesColumns>` and are the smallest, most atomic part of a :ref:`a V2 calculator's hierarchy<uxV2Structure>`.
They represent single individual entities to the user --- variable input fields, images, blocks of text, etc.

There are currently three types of blocks, each with their own intent and accompanying guidelines:

* :ref:`Variable blocks <uxVariableBlock>`
* :ref:`Text blocks <uxTextBlock>`
* :ref:`Image blocks <uxImageBlock>`
