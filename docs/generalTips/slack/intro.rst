Slack
=================================================

Slack is how we communicate day-to-day. It is a useful website that combines group and individual instant messaging and allows you to share images and links as well. If you ever need to talk to someone this is primarily how you’ll do it - just message them and they’ll get back to you as soon as possible. This is also where groups and projects communicate and coordinate through; each project tends to have its own channel.

Slack, of course, has its own useful guide on its features: https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/help/articles/360059928654-How-to-use-Slack--your-quick-start-guide

Channels tend to come and go with the seasons, so it's not very useful to list them all here. There are some permanent channels though, which are worth describing:

* general - Anything that we want everyone at Omni to see gets posted here. This includes any reminders, organisation of our general call, tasks, developer updates and birthday reminders.
* entertainment - A place to share and discuss any interesting media you've found recently.
* photos - Took any lovely pics recently? We’d love to see them too!
* diy - If you’ve got any hard work to share, this is the place. Who knows, it may even become a calculator!
* media - Where we share all of Omni’s appearances across the internet.
* calculatorians - The main channel for calculatorians. Where we organise meetings and projects that concern our content creators. If you have any questions about making calculators or writing text, post them here.
* memes - Self-explanatory.
* hot-topic - Got an idea for a marketing calculator that needs making today? Post it here.
* bugs - Found a bug on Omni’s website? Share it here, preferably with pictures and steps on how to replicate it please.
* marketing - The internal chat for our marketing team. If you have any ideas for how to get Omni’s name out there, I’m sure our team will be glad to here them, but otherwise, don’t post in this chat unless you’re in marketing or working on a marketing calculator.
* developers - The internal chat for our developers. **Please, do not post in here**. If you have any suggestions or ideas, please discuss them first with your superior or in the calculatorians channel, where they will be handled accordingly. Also, its written in that most frightful of languages - Polish.

You may see some channels begin with zzz. These channels are usually for some transient project and will be deleted once it is complete. The zzz is used to push the channel to the bottom of the a-z search as not to interfere with the main channels.
