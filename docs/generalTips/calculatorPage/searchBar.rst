To find and discover other calculators that might help you or you want to link to, the best way is to use the **search bar** at the top-right of the calculator page.

Start typing in a keyword and the search results will appear underneath. The 10 best calculators are shown.

.. tip::
  To find more internal links for your calculator text, enter words from your text into the search bar to see if we have a calculator based on that word. Below is an example when entering the word "car".
