For detailed documentation on each of these pages, click on the links in the list above.

.. tip::
  Clicking on these links will replace the calculator page. If you want to open them in a new tab instead, you can right-click on the link and choose **Open link in new tab** (or similar).

Page age
--------

After the list of links, information about **when the page was generated** is shown. This is so you know whether you are looking at a version of the calculator that includes the changes you just made, or an old version. Try **reloading the page** to get the latest version (this can take ~10 minutes).

Overwrite locale data
---------------------

To help test your calculator as if you were a user in another country, you can change the locale data.

There are three settings to play with:

* **Country code** — Allows you to change the country you report to the calculator. Use the standard `two-letter country codes <https://www.iban.com/country-codes>`_.
* **Currency** — Allows you to change the currency you report to the calculator. Use the standard `three-letter currency codes <https://www.iban.com/currency-codes>`_.
* **Imperial units** — Checking this box will make any variables that have a default imperial unit provided display that unit.

To make a change:

1. Make the changes you want.
2. Click the **[Save]** button.
3. Click the **Reset defaults** button, in order to see the imperial units update.

To **reset back to your regular settings**, press the **[Reset]** button.

.. warning::
  Changed local settings apply **site-wide, to all calculators** and will remain until changed or reset.
