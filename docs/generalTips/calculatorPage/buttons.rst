There are several handy links available to you once you click on the **gear cog icon** in the top-right hand corner of the calculator page.

* :ref:`Edit calculator <editCalculator>` — opens the edit calculator page;
* :ref:`Edit text <writingTexts>` — opens the edit text page;
* :ref:`Google Analytics <googleAnalytics>` — opens the Google Analytics page for this calculator — shows traffic this calculator is getting;
* :ref:`Google Search Console <searchConsole>` — opens the Google Search Console for this calculator — show which keywords people used to find the calculator; and
* `Page Speed Insights <https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/v5/about>`_ — *(mainly for develops)* analyses the speed of the page.

For detailed documentation on each of these pages, click on the links in the list above.

.. tip::
  Clicking on these links will replace the calculator page. If you want to open them in a new tab instead, you can right-click on the link and choose **Open link in new tab** (or similar).

After the list of links, information about **when the page was generated** is shown. This is so you know whether you are looking at a version of the calculator that includes the changes you just made, or an old version. Try **reloading the page** to get the latest version.
