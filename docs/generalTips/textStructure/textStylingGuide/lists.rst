Lists
=====

All lists should have their entries **begin with a capital** (unless that word never has a capital). If a list (excluding sets of instructions) has **no entries that are more than one sentence** long then they should end with a **semicolon**, the penultimate entry should follow the semicolon with “and”, and the final entry should end with a full stop:

* Beginning;
* Middle; and
* End.

If a single entry is **more than one sentence**, all entries should end with a **full stop**. 

When writing a **set of instructions**, please use an :ref:`ordered list <markdownOrderedLists>` (numbered). Ideally, the first word should be an imperative as well, but you can compromise on this in favour of a more informal style. Ordered lists can also be used to list ideas in order of priority, such as the ten best footballers.

:ref:`Unordered <markdownUnorderedLists>` lists can be used in many different ways, but if you want to use them to describing many different terms, please use this style:

* Mass spectroscopy — Where the molecules are ionised.
* Infra red — Where the molecules are dissolved in solution.

If you can't decide whether or not to use an ordered list or an unordered list, **choose unordered**.
