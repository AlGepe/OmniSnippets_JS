Section names
=============

Section names in the text are very important as they are included in the :ref:`table of contents <tableOfContents>`, aiding in user navigation, and have an improved SEO score. As keywords are often what people search for, many of them lend themselves well to being titles too, e.g., “circumference definition” and “how to find circumference”. Therefore, you are expected to include at **least 3 keywords** in headings.

If you want to write an FAQ question that you also think is important enough to warrant its own entry in the table of contents, you can click on the ``::qa:x::`` button next to it and copy it into the text at the appropriate place. This will move the faq to this spot, with the question as a new heading. For information about this :ref:`here <faqReferencingFAQinMainText>`.
