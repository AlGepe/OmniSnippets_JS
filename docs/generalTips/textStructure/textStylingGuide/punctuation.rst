Punctuation
===========

Spaces
------

* Separate **numbers** and their **units** with a space:

  * :green:`500 A`, :green:`120 V` instead of :red:`500A`, :red:`120V`.

* Don't put a space between a value and the **percentage sign**:

  * :green:`50%` instead of :red:`50 %`.

* For **angles**, don't add a space between the value and the degree symbol, but do add a space if the value is a **temperature**:

  * :green:`45°` instead of :red:`45 °`
  * :green:`36.6 °C` instead of :red:`36.6°C`

* Don't add space before a question mark, exclamation mark, colon, etc.

  * :red:`How do I calculator margin ?`

* Add spaces around the operators in equations (e.g., ``+``, ``-``, ``×``, ``/``):

  * :green:`cups = weight / (cup size × product density)`
  * However, for **short fractions**, don't add spaces: :green:`4/5, distance/100`
  * Don't add spaces between symbols in units: :green:`kg·m/s²`
  * When using the **plus minus sign (±)**, we do not add spaces around it: :green:`The net weight is 650 g (±1 g)`

Dashes, hyphens and pauses
--------------------------

* A **short hyphen** (i.e., the "-" character available from the keyboard) is used in the following contexts:

  * Arabic numerals denoting ranges:

    * :green:`1914-1918, 20-30 cm, as 9:30-12:00` instead of :red:`1914 - 1918, 20 - 30 cm, as 9:30 - 12:00`
    * Exception: If the the range looks extremely bad without spaces (with longer numerical ranges), you can use a short dash with spaces on both sides:

      * :green:`02/08/2008 - 15/12/2009`
    
    * When any number in the range is negative, we do not use a dash or hyphen, but the construction from ... to ...

      * :green:`From -20 to +30 °C` instead of :red:`-20-30 °C`

  * Scientific terms:

    * :green:`b-carotene`

  * Multi-word compounds:

    * :green:`Two-, three-, or four-dimensional`

  * In mathematical formulas, the minus sign is separated on both sides by spaces:

    * :green:`4 - 2 = 2`

  * When used as the sign of a negative number, don't use a space:

    * :green:`-2 degrees Celsius`

* **Long pause**: In the function of a hyphen, as an interjection, separation, explanation — use a em-dash character (``Alt + 0151``) with spaces either side:

  * :green:`What type of figure am I — is it an hourglass, a triangle, or a rectangle?`
  * :green:`Slow — or 0.9 m/s (2.8 MET)`
  * :green:`Slope — or gradient — has many uses in everyday life.`

  If we use explanations in a list that are sentences, use an em-dash character to separate the list item and the sentence that explains it. As with all sentences, it should start with a capital letter:

  * :green:`To determine your cat's age, you can check the following:`

    1. :green:`Teeth — Their condition, presence (absence or not), and color will indicate whether the cat is young or old.`
    2. :green:`Eyes — Cloudy eyes are a sign of a senior cat.`

Periods
-------

* Do not put periods (full stops) in section headers.
* Place a period after an abbreviated title.

  * :green:`Dr. Watson` instead of :red:`Dr Watson`

Separation of nonrestrictive clauses
------------------------------------

For nonrestrictive clauses, we can also use dashes or parentheses to separate them from the rest of the sentence.

In terms of emphasis, **dashes > commas > parentheses**. For example:

* :green:`Dennis took his car (a tiny, two-door Honda) on a weekend road trip.` **Least emphasis**
* :green:`Dennis took his car, a two-door Honda, on a weekend road trip.`
* :green:`Dennis stuffed his four best friends into his car — a tiny, two-door Honda — for a weekend road trip.` **Most emphasis**
