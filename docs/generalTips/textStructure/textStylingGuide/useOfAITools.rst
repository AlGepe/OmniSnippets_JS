Use of AI tools
===============

When considering content generated by artificial intelligence (AI) and LLMs (large language models), it is important to **treat it like any other page on the Internet**. You can't just copy and paste their output; you need to fact-check the information using other sources or your own knowledge. There have been cases of `jokes on Reddit <https://www.thedailybeast.com/google-explains-why-its-ai-overviews-told-users-to-eat-rocks-and-glue-pizzas>`_ being reported by LLMs very confidently as facts. If the information is good, you'll need to absorb it and write the content in your own words.

LLMs work by using a large corpus of text information scrapped from the Internet and using that information to predict a response to a prompt. So, it is very possible that the LLM may reproduce copyrighted material from third parties in its response. As a result, Omni can't claim a copyright to such material.

However, you can use AI to **brainstorm topics and questions**; it will probably help you consider aspects of a subject you hadn't thought about.

.. note::

  The translation team uses AI to get a first rough draft of a translation, but they are always expected to refine this to make it accurate and easy to read for the user.

LLMs are more **writing aids** than replacements. They are good at:

* Brainstorming
* Drafting
* Editing
* Outlining
* Planning
* Summarizing
* Transcribing
* Translating

What they are not so good at is math and reasoning. They have no internal model of what a “fact” is.

Images
------
**Avoid generating images and diagrams with AI.** For diagrams, we want to use Marjie to create images in the Omni style. Also, avoid including pictures in texts because they look nice. Again, images produced by AI, even if you pay for a service, can not be copyrighted by Omni.


Approved list of tools
----------------------

Here is the current list of approved tools and their features. Note that these details may quickly become out of date. If you like to add a tool to the list, contact Steve.

* `Perplexity <https://www.perplexity.ai>`_

  * Perplexity summaries search results around a query or question, so generally, it provides up-to-date information.
  * It provides inline references to each “fact” in the summary, making it easy to check the source.
  * It can be much quicker than Google to get an answer that works.
  * Perplexity can be used every day as a replacement for Google.
  * It can be used to surface information in large datasets.
  * Use the Focus feature to constrain the type of inputs used and generated outputs — for example, Wolfram mode for math questions.
* `ChatGPT <https://openai.com/chatgpt/>`_

  * ChatGPT is a complete LLM chatbot and the first to go mainstream. It is best used to go back and forth (chat) with it on a topic.
  * May provide out-of-date information.
  * It often gets things wrong, so it needs careful cross-checking and confirmation.
  * Omni has a paid account you can use — see Omni's BitWarden Vault.
* `Google Gemini <https://gemini.google.com>`_

  * Very similar to ChatGPT but uses real-time Internet data to produce more accurate results.
  * Gemini produces multiple drafts, so if you don't like its response, you can quickly get a variation that you might like better.
  * Can handle much larger context sources (information you provide) to generate responses (e.g., asking questions about a document).


How to use AI chatbots
----------------------
When using chatbots such as ChatGPT and Gemini, it is best to talk to them like a person and assign a role to them. Here are some tips when it comes to writing prompts:

* Role and goal

  * Say who they should be and what the goal is. For instance, "You are a governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) analyst. Write a detailed remediation strategy for an accounts payable control failure".
* Constraints

  * Put constraints on the answer you are looking for.
* Ask single questions

  * Avoid overwhelming the AI with multiple questions at once. Focus on one question at a time for more coherent responses.
* Provide context and examples

  * Give the AI background information or context related to your question. This helps the model understand the topic better and provide a more accurate response. Also, include examples of what you want in your prompt.
* Type of output

  * Specify the type of output you are looking for.
* Use one AI to write a prompt for another AI

  * For example, ask ChatGPT to generate a prompt for Stable Diffusion (an image-generating AI), which will include more detail than you could think of. Then, if it isn't quite right, you can tweak it further to suit your needs.
* Iterate and experiment

  * Try different prompts and refine them based on the responses you get. This iterative process can help you find the most effective prompts for your needs.
* Be nice to the AI

  * A `recent study <https://www.rg-cs.co.uk/featured-article-try-being-nice-to-your-ai/>`_ indicates that including "please" in your prompt and generally being nice gets you better results.


AI detection
------------

Please note that your texts will be checked for AI content and you may be required to rewrite the text to be more human. Here are a few tips on how do to this:

* Include a little humor and personality (e.g., a personal story).
* Vary sentence structure and length.
* Avoid repetitive phrases and clichés.
* Tailor your writing style to the expected audience (e.g., school kid vs. finance professional).
