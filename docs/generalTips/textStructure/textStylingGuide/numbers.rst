Numbers, dates and times
========================

Formatting of numbers
---------------------

* **Decimal separator** — Use a comma (not a comma) in decimal numbers:

  * :green:`Calibrators can be 3.1, 4.0, or 4.9 in diameter.`
  * :red:`Calibrators can be 3,1, 4,0, or 4,9 in diameter.`

* **Thousands separator** — Use commas (not spaces) to separate multi-digit numbers of five-digits numbers and larger. Separation into three-digit groups does not apply to digits after the decimal point:

  * :green:`5348.26`
  * :green:`25,772.1`
  * :green:`9,212,345.576213`
  * :green:`The total amount is $1,500,200.`
  * :red:`The total amount is $1 500 200.`

* Distinguish between countable and uncountable nouns:

  * :green:`Number of hours.`
  * :red:`Amount of hours.`
  * :green:`Amount of snow.`
  * :red:`Number of mass.`

Formatting of dates
-------------------

Since the vast majority of our English calculator texts are written in American English, we should follow the convention in the US of putting the month first, then the day and finally the year.

* :green:`04/13/19` or 04.13.19 or 04-13-19 (first format preferred)
* :green:`04/13/2019` or 04.13.2019 or 04-13-2019 (first format preferred)
* :green:`Apr. 13, 2019`

Note that there should be a leading zero if either the month or day is less than 10.

To avoid possible confusion for visitors from the UK and Europe, you can opt to state the month first in words (either in full or abbreviated) in calculator texts. For JS or engine v2 output of dates, they should use the users locale information to format the date correctly.

If the calculator text is targeting a particular country, use the format used in that country:

* UK & much of Europe - day/month/year - 13/04/19
* Asia - year/month/day - 13/04/19

Use cardinal numbers (1, 2, 3) rather than ordinal numbers (1st, 2nd, 3rd) when writing the date.

* :red:`Daniel was born on May 13th.`
* :green:`Daniel was born on May 13.`

To write the full date with commas, there is a different rule for US and non-US date formats. For the US, place commas after the day and year. For non-US, don't use any commas.

* US:

  * :red:`On May 13th, 2007 Daniel was born.`
  * :green:`On May 13, 2007, Daniel was born.`

* Non-US:

  * :red:`On 13 May, 2007, Daniel was born.`
  * :green:`On 13 May 2007 Daniel was born.`

If you are using the word "of" in your sentence, then you can use the ordinal number.

* :green:`Daniel was born on the 13th of May.`

That does, though, make the sentence wordier, which you might want to avoid.
You can also use the ordinal number if there is no reference to the month.

* :green:`Daniel was born on the thirteenth.`
* :green:`Daniel was born on the 13th.`

When including the day of the week, place a comma after the day name to ensure readability.

* :green:`How fortunate that the world did not end on Friday, December 21, 2012!`

* :green:`Monday, May 5, is my last day of work.`

**How to write centuries**

When referring to a century by numerical year, do not use an apostrophe before the "s". Centuries contain 100 years, so it is plural, not possessive.When referring to a century using words, use all lowercase letters.

* :red:`Women often wore bonnets in the 1800's.`
* :green:`Women often wore bonnets in the 1800s.`
* :green:`Women often wore bonnets in the eighteen hundreds.`
* :red:`Women often wore bonnets in the Nineteenth Century.`
* :green:`Women often wore bonnets in the nineteenth century.`

**How to write decades**

When writing about the years in a decade, you use an apostrophe to indicate the missing first two digits and no apostrophe before the "s" — for the same reason explained above. You can write the year out in full too.

* :green:`My mother was born in the '40s.`
* :green:`My mother was born in the 1940s.`
* :red:`In the 80's, I had a haircut like the lead singer of A Flock of Seagulls.`
* :green:`In the '80s, I had a haircut like the lead singer of A Flock of Seagulls.`
* :green:`In the eighties, I had a haircut like the lead singer of A Flock of Seagulls.`

Formatting of times
-------------------

Use the 12-hour format and specify either a.m. or p.m. to indicate before or after noon. Most English-speaking countries don't know and are confused by the 24-hour clock format.

* :green:`12:29 p.m.`
* :red:`16:29`

Use colons between hours, minutes and seconds (if required):

* :green:`2:30:05 p.m.`
* :green:`5:45 p.m.`

Midnight is 12:00 a.m. and 12-noon is 12:00 p.m.
