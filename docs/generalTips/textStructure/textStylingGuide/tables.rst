Tables
======

For a guide on **how to create tables**, please check the :ref:`Tables <textEditorTables>` section of the Text Editor section.

Please **capitalize the first word** in all table entries. Tables should have the **dependant variable**, i.e., the one being measured across the top row, and the subsequent entries should be the **independent variable**, i.e., the one you are changing.

If you are presenting a table that is the data used in a value select in the calculator, the **order should be the same as in the tool**. If this is not the case, the entries should be sorted for the most user friendly experience, usually alphabetically or numerically. 

.. tip::
  For tables with **2 to 3 columns**, try setting the **width** setting to **100%**. It will then look good on mobile and not look too narrow on desktop.
