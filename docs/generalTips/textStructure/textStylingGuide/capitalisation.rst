Capitalization
==============

There a few rules regarding capitalization:

* Any new line, including new paragraphs, a new line after a colon, new entries in a bullet point list, etc, should begin with a capital.
* When describing the variables of an equation, **please capitalize** the first letter after the hyphen (you can check the :ref:`Equations and their variables <equationsAndVariables>` section for an example).
* Common acronyms and abbreviations, such as SOS, IR, and FBI, should be capitalized. Often, you’ll want to include a breakdown of what the letters stand for after, usually for SEO reasons. In this case, the breakdown should only be capitalized if it is a proper noun. E.g., “in this MS calculator, or mass spectroscopy calculator” or “the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).”
* For ellipsis (...), you can use them both in the middle of a sentence or at the end of one, usually for... dramatic effect. If it's in the middle, like I just did, you don't need to capitalize the next word, regardless of what Grammarly tells you… If the sentence is at an end though, normal capitalization rules apply.
