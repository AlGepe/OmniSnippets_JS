Text length
-----------

Texts should be a minimum of 500 words. This includes headings and any FAQs. If you are struggling to meet this count, you can look on google or SEMrush for keywords around the topic, which hopefully will give you ideas on what to write.

You should also try not to go over 2000 words. Longer texts do not see a proportional increase in clicks, so writing very long texts is usually not worth your time. But, if you have reached 2000 words and have not yet fully explained all the key concepts, you can go over it.

Remember that the SEO phrases have a required concentration in the text; as you write more, the more keywords you will have to include.
