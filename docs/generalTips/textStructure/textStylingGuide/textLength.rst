Text length
===========

The rules for choosing the length of a text:

* Look at TOP 3 results in Google for your main phrase and see how long their texts are. As a rule of thumb, it's good to have a text longer than each of these. Example: the competition wrote 300 words, 0 words, and 900 words, then aim for 1100-1200 words in your text.
* Absolute minimum is ~500 words. This includes headings and any FAQs. If you are struggling to meet this count, you can look on Google or SEMrush for keywords around the topic, which hopefully will give you ideas on what to write.
* Make sure to write enough to explain the topic, explain how the calculator works, include the keywords in necessary saturation, etc. (but I think you know that :P)
* Don't go crazy if the SEO potential is low (e.g. when we have only 1000 searches a month, it makes no sense to bleed out a 2k+ text).
* You should also try **not to go over 2000 words**. Longer texts do not see a proportional increase in clicks, so writing very long texts is usually not worth your time. The only case when you really should exceed 2k words is if the main phrase is really searched for (let's say, 10k+), and our competition has long, high-quality texts.

.. note::
Remember that the SEO phrases have a required concentration in the text; as you **write more**, the **more keywords** you will have to include.
