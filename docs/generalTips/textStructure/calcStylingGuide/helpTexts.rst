Help texts
----------

Help texts can useful to provide the user with **extra information** that may help them to understand what is expected in the field. This includes:

* An **explanation** of what the variable means.
* Where to find, or how to take, a measurement.
* An expected **range of inputs** (if you’d rather not use the hard limits of conditions).
* A reference to where the variable is better explained in the text.
* A note to use the **advanced mode** if you’d like a default changed, or any other reason someone may need to use the advanced mode.

There are of course many other reasons that a help text may be used, but these are some of the common ones. 

However, **please do not use a help text to merely rephrase the variable**, e.g., for “Circumference”, the help text reads “The circumference of a circle.” Such a help text is redundant and doesn’t add anything to the user’s experience.
