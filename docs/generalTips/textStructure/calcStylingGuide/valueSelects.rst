Value selects
-------------

Value selects should **begin with a capital** but do not need a full stop. They do not need a capital if its variable name is the beginning of a sentence which the value select completes. Question marks can be used as appropriate.

If the value select is a list of different entries, e.g., metal alloys, then the list should be alphabetical or numerical. Otherwise, the order should just be logical.
