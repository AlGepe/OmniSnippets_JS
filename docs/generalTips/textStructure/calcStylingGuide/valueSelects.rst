Value selects
-------------

Value selects should **begin with a capital** but do not need a full stop. They do not need a capital if its variable name is the beginning of a sentence which the value select completes. Question marks can be used as appropriate.

If the value select is a list of different entries, e.g., metal alloys, types of bird, or orders in the equation, then the list should be alphabetical or numerical. Otherwise, e.g., the user is choosing the function of the calculator, the order should just be logical.
