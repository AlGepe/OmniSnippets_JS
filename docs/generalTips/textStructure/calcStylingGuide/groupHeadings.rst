Group headings
--------------

Grouping variables together is important for making the calculator as clear as possible. The headings should begin with a capital and not end with punctuation, unless its for effect, e.g., a question mark or exclamation mark. There is no strict guide here, as long as your headings improve the user experience, anything is permitted.
