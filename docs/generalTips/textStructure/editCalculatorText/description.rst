How to write a good meta description
------------------------------------

What is a meta description?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A meta description is an HTML attribute that provides a brief summary of the content of a web page. It's typically used by search engines to display a snippet or preview of the page in search results. Here's an example of how a meta description might look in HTML:

``<meta data-rh="true" content="Use this free circumference calculator to find the area, circumference and diameter of a circle." name="description"/>``

In this example, if someone searched for "circumference calculator" and this page appeared in the search results, the provided meta description might be displayed beneath the page title in the search results.

**In the BB text editor, we refer to the meta description as "Description".**

Here are some key points about meta descriptions:

1. **Purpose**: The primary purpose of a meta description is to give searchers a quick insight into the content of a page, helping them decide whether or not to click on a search result. It can also play a role in improving click-through rates from search results.

2. **Placement**: It's placed within the ``<head>`` section of an HTML document, using the ``<meta>`` tag with the ``name`` attribute set to "description".

3. **Length**: While there's no strict limit, it's generally recommended that meta descriptions be between 50-155 characters long to ensure they display correctly in most search engines.

4. **Content**: It should be a concise and accurate representation of the page's content. It's also a good practice to include relevant keywords, but it's essential to avoid keyword stuffing.

5. **Customization**: If a meta description is not provided for a page or if it is not relevant to the webpage, search engines might generate one based on the page's content or use a snippet from the page that matches the user's query.

How do you write a good meta description?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Writing a compelling meta description is crucial for attracting users to click on our website from search engine results. Here are some best practices and tips for crafting an effective meta description:

1. **Be Concise**: Aim for a **length of 50-155 characters**. This ensures that your entire description is visible in most search engines without being cut off. You can use the `SERP simulator tool by Mangools <https://mangools.com/free-seo-tools/serp-simulator?ref=menu-mngls>`_ to check the length of the meta description. 

2. **Include Relevant Keywords**: Incorporate keywords that are relevant to the content of the page. This not only highlights the relevance of our page to searchers but also can make the keywords bold in search results if they match the user's query.

3. **Write for the User**: Our primary audience is the searcher, not search engines. Make sure the description accurately represents the content of the page and entices users to click through.

4. **Use a Call-to-Action (CTA)**: Encourage users to take action with phrases like “Calculate”, "Learn more," "Discover," or "Get started”.

5. **Avoid Duplicate Descriptions**: Each page on our website should have a unique meta description. Duplicate descriptions can make it difficult for users to distinguish between different pages on our site.

6. **Avoid Non-Alphanumeric Characters**: Some characters, like quotation marks, can get truncated or misinterpreted by search engines. It's best to avoid them or use HTML entities if necessary.

8. **Use Active Voice**: Active voice tends to be more engaging and direct, making it more compelling for users.

9. **Stay Updated**: If the content of our page changes significantly, remember to update the meta description to reflect those changes.

**Remember, a well-crafted meta description can significantly improve click-through rates, benefiting our SEO efforts.** These 1-2 lines are our opportunity to “advertise” our tools to the searchers, and the searcher's chance to decide whether our content is likely to be relevant to the information they are trying to get. Therefore, it is important that we put some effort into writing it.
