    The SEO check tools are location on the right-hand side of the calculator text editor page.

There is the **Keywords tab**, where you list the keywords associated with this calculator. The SEO checker then makes sure your text has the right keyword saturation, keywords in headings, titles, description, etc.

The **Links tab** is where you can add and easily insert links to other related calculators.

The **Preview tab** gives you a preview of the rendered HTML, so you can check you have the right formatting, etc.

There is then the **Global SEO** that performs other checks on your text, such as length, bullet list quality and alt text for images.

Finally, there is the **Cheat sheet** tab that contains a handy reference to common Markdown syntax. The full reference of how Markdown is used at Omni is in the :ref:`Markdown<markdown>` section of this manual.

.. warning::
    The SEO checker **takes a few seconds to run when** you first open the calculator text editor page. Give it a chance to finish running before drawing any conclusions from the SEO checks.
