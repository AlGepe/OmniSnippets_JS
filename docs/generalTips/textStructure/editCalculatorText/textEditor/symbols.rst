Symbols
=====================

You may use most Unicode and Emoji symbols in your texts. Let's explore how to get them into your texts.

Copy and paste
--------------

One of the easiest ways is to copy and paste symbols that are used somewhere else. This Handbook as some useful ones :ref:`here <unicodeSymbols>` you can copy.

For Unicode subscripts and superscripts numbers, this `Wikipedia page <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_subscripts_and_superscripts>`_ is very helpful. 

And perhaps one of the easiest ways to find Unicode symbols is just to **Google them**!

Operating system character pickers
----------------------------------

Your operating system probably has a special character/Emoji picker that you can use. Some even keep the ones you use most frequently on the first page.

Windows 10
^^^^^^^^^^

Press ``WinKey + .`` or ``WinKey + ;`` to bring up the Emoji picker. Emojis? I'm looking for symbols. Well, if you scroll across to the right far enough, you'll also find lots of symbols. Find out more `here <https://www.howtogeek.com/351344/how-to-use-windows-10%E2%80%99s-new-emoji-picker-in-any-app/>`_.

You can also use alt codes to type special characters. More details on this `Microsoft support page <https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-10-keyboard-tips-and-tricks-588e0b72-0fff-6d3f-aeee-6e5116097942>`_.

Windows 7
^^^^^^^^^

You can use the Character Map program to search for symbols and characters. To launch it, press the Start menu (or press ``WinKey``) and type ``charmap`` in the search box, and press Enter.

You can then select the symbols you need and copy them to the clipboard, then paste them into your text. Here is a `short guide <https://www.dummies.com/computers/operating-systems/windows-7/how-to-insert-special-characters-with-windows-7-character-map/>`_ with further details.

Stick to using the Arial font for compatibility.

.. tip::
  The Character Map is still available in **Windows 10** if you prefer the old way of finding symbols.

MacOS
^^^^^

Use either **^âŒ˜Space** or, from the menu bar, **Edit â†’ Emoji & Symbols** to bring up MacOS's Emoji and symbol picker. You can find symbols, if you scroll down far enough.

Learn more about how to use the picker with `this guide <https://readdle.com/use-emoji-on-mac-tutorial>`_.

ChromeOS
^^^^^^^^

Here is a `guide to entering symbols <https://www.groovypost.com/howto/type-special-characters-chromebook-accents-symbols-em-dashes>`_ in ChromeOS and here is `how to bring up an Emoji picker <https://9to5google.com/2018/02/12/how-to-use-emoji-chrome-os-android-basics/>`_.

Emoji
-----

We've mentioned a few times already, but Emoji are sort of symbols too, but a bit more fun. Omni loves Emojis, but we have to be a bit careful when using them.

We don't want to use the very latest ones, otherwise most people will only see an empty square instead of a gorgeous emoji.

As a rule of thumb, **don't use** and emoji or Unicode characters that have been released in the last **4 years**.

To check the age of an emoji, search for it on `Emojipedia <https://emojipedia.org/>`_. You can either search by its name or the emoji itself (how cool ðŸ˜Ž). This site also gives you a handy copy button for each emoji, in case any other the methods above fail.
