Text editing with sections and blocks
=================================================

The calculator text editor consists of a number of sections (equivalent to level 2 ## headings) and content blocks (different block types for different content types).

Sections
--------

A section is the top-level building block of your calculator text. Each section has a title and a number of content blocks.

.. note::
  The section title is what you used to denote with ## in the previous text editor.

Every calculator has a special "Lead" section, with at least one text content block. While you cannot delete this text block, you can add more blocks to the lead section.

To **add a new section**, click on the three dots icon to the right of the section title and click **Add section**. For other sections that come after the lead section, you can delete the section by selecting **Delete section** from the section drop-down menu.

.. tip::
  The number after the title of a section indicates the **number of words** contained within that section.

.. seealso::
  FAQs (frequently asked questions) are defined using two buttons to the right of the section title; **Schema** and **FAQ**.

  Learn more about managing FAQs in the :ref:`FAQs technical section <faq>`  of the manual. 

Content blocks
--------------

Content blocks are the heart of the text editor. There are currently five different types:

* :ref:`Text block <textEditorTextBlock>` — Entering paragraphs of text.
* :ref:`Image block <pictures>` — Adding images to text.
* :ref:`Video block <videos>` — Adding embedding videos in text (marketing/SciComm calculators only really).
* :ref:`Table block <textEditorTables>` — Adding tables to text.
* :ref:`Formula block <textEditorFormulaBlock>` — Adding fancy LaTeX-style equations to text.

.. note::
  To delete a content block, click on the three-dot icon and click on **Delete block**. Note that the first text block of a section cannot be deleted.

Reordering sections and content blocks
--------------------------------------

To change the ordering of content blocks or sections, use the up and down arrow icon to drag the block up or down.
