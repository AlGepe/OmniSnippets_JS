Equations
=========

Equations in your text can either use the code font (monospace) or the :ref:`Formula block <textEditorFormulaBlock>` for LaTeX-style equations. Here we will focus on use of the monospaced code font. This can be achieved by enclosing the equation in **backtick** characters.

Generally, we use an asterisk as the multiplication symbol. So, the equation for the area of a circle would be typed as:

```A = 𝜋 * r²```

And rendered as:

``A = 𝜋 * r²``

As a rule, leave a space around each operator to aid readability.

.. note::
  In an answer to an FAQ, please use the multiplication sign character ``×`` instead of an asterisk character. This is to keep Google happy.

Superscripts and subscripts
---------------------------

For superscripts and subscripts, please either use Unicode characters (`here is a good resource of these <https://lingojam.com/TinyTextGenerator>`_) or use a :ref:`Formula block <textEditorFormulaBlock>` if no suitable Unicode character is available or the results look bad.

.. tip::
  If you use multiple Unicode superscript and subscript numbers together, the spacing can look odd. In such cases, please use a :ref:`Formula block <textEditorFormulaBlock>` to present the equation.

Symbols
-------

If you need to use special symbols in your equation, check out the :ref:`Symbols <symbols>` section of this handbook.
