HTML
====

The basic rule going forward is, **don't use HTML!** In the first phase of the new text editor, you will receive a **warning** that your text contains HTML. You should try and remove it and replace it with the new ways of doing things, if you have time.

At some later date, you will **not be able to save calculator texts** that contain HTML.

Currently, you can technically use any HTML you like and it will work. However, it is not recommend to use anything but simple HTML tags to do things that you can't do with :ref:`Markdown <markdown>`.

The main things you use HTML in texts are for :ref:`links <links>`, :ref:`tables <textEditorTables>`, and :ref:`images <pictures>`.

Please review the following updated documentation pages on how to do things, now HTML has been deprecated:

* :ref:`Links <links>`
* :ref:`Tables <textEditorTables>`
* :ref:`Images <pictures>`
* :ref:`Formulas <textEditorFormulaBlock>`
* :ref:`Code-base equations <equations>`
