HTML
=====================

Currently, you can technically use any HTML you like and it will work. However, it is not recommend to use anything but simple HTML tags to do things that you can't do with :ref:`Markdown <markdown>`.

The main things you use HTML in texts are for :ref:`links <links>`, :ref:`tables <textEditorTables>`, and :ref:`images <pictures>`.

.. warning::
  An update is in the works to **remove support for HTML tag** and move towards classes (or another interface) to format text. You may carry on for now, but just note that any mention of HTML tags in this handbook will soon be out of date.


No style for you!
-----------------

You should avoid using any inline CSS in your texts via the ``style`` tag attribute. Ask on :ref:`Slack <slack>` first to check that it is OK.
