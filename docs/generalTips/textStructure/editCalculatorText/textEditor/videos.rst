Video block
=====================

.. note::
  While you can embed videos directly in your texts, this **should generally only be done for marketing calculators**, due to the large file sizes associated with the video on first page load. You can of course include a :ref:`link <links>` to the video in your text.


You can embed YouTube and other online videos by adding a video block to your text. To add a video block, click on the three-dot menu of an existing block and click on **Add video block**. You should then copy the URL of the video and paste it into the main input box of the video block.

  Example of adding a YouTube URL to a video block.

If you click on the video block's three-dot menu, you will see **options very similar to the image block**. Since these work the same, I'll direct you to the :ref:`options part <textEditorImageBlockAlignment>` of the image block page.

.. note::
  There is no alt text option for a video block.
