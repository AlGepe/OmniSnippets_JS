A note on medical calculators
--------------------------

Because having the answers read out to them may be a person's only contact with us, they will not see our usual medical disclaimer. So, if you are writing a medical calculator, please write “Please consult a doctor if you need assistance” or something similar if you think it's appropriate. Remember to err on the safe side for this kind of thing.
