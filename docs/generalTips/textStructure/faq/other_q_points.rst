Topics to avoid
===============

There are certain questions that may seem like a good idea, but you should **avoid entirely** because we are far outcompeted by other websites. These include:

* Anything involving programs/apps, for example **Excel**; and
* Anything where, upon googling the question, **Google presents its own tool**, e.g., “How do I calculate the volume of a cylinder?”

Other than that, there's not much else you should avoid like the plague; questions of all types **can be chosen if you think they really fit the brief**.

Question length
===============

It seems that longer questions, around the 6-9 words mark, work best. Try to aim for this for most of your questions, but, of course, if you see the perfect question that’s 4 words, we can still get those. I would not, however, go over the maximum of 13 words - it’s just too long.

Don’t pick all of the most popular questions
============================================

**Please don't pick all of the most common/ popular questions from SEMrush as we are often outcompeted**.

Therefore, about **half of your questions can be highly searched ones** and those integral to the calculator, e.g. “How to find density?” in the density calculator, but **the other half should be slightly more obscure**, such as how to’s for specific instructions or specific questions.


**Number of question that do or do not have FS or gFAQ vs. the question’s volume in SEMrush**

As you can see, our rate of getting FS or gFAQs tails off at the highest search volume.   

When adding FAQs to old calculators, **look at calculator’s popularity**. If we the first result for loads of keywords, then you can write **more high popularity** questions, because Google trusts us. If the **calculator is extremely unpopular**, you might only want to write **one or two popular questions**.
