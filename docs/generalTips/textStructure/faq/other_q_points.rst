Topics to avoid
===============

There are certain questions that may seem like a good idea, but you should **avoid entirely** because we are far outcompeted by other websites. These include:

* Anything involving programs/apps, for example **Excel**; and
* Anything where, upon googling the question, **Google presents its own tool**, e.g., “How do I calculate the volume of a cylinder?”

Other than that, there's not much else you should avoid like the plague; questions of all types **can be chosen if you think they really fit the brief**.

Question length
===============

It seems that longer questions, around the 6-9 words mark, work best. Try to aim for this for most of your questions, but, of course, if you see the perfect question that’s 4 words, we can still get those. I would not, however, go over the maximum of 13 words - it’s just too long.
