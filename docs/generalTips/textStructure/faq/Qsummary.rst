Question summary
================

* Write questions that are to do with calculating things, solving problems, and examples.
* Because of the above, most of your questions will begin with “What…” and “How…”.
* Include at least one question that is a specific example, e.g., **"What is the midpoint of 30 and 60?"**.
* Any “How…”s should be “How do I…”,  occasionally “How to…”.
* Avoid definitions and Excel.
* Check that Google isn’t providing its own tools to answer the question.
* Questions should ideally be between **6-9 words**, but **no more than 13**.
* The popularity of the questions you pick should be related to the strength of the calculator.
