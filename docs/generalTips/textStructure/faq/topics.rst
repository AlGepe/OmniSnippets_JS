Topics to avoid
-------------

There are certain questions that may seem like a good idea, but you should **avoid entirely** because we are far outcompeted by other websites. These include:

* **Definitions**/etymologies of words - dictionaries exist.
* Anything involving programs/apps, for example **Excel**.
* Anything where, upon googling the question, **Google presents its own tool**, e.g., “How do I calculate the volume of a cylinder?”

Other than that, there's not much else you should avoid like the plague; questions of all types **can be chosen if you think they really fit the brief**.
