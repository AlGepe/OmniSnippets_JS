Checking questions on Google
============================

It's often a good idea to **google your question** before you start writing about it. There are several outcomes, all relating exclusively to FSs:

* **There’s no FS** — Go for it! It may take some time to get it, but we should be okay.
* **Google has its own tool** — We’ll never get this one. I might be worth rewording the question slightly, still in the form that someone might reasonably ask, and checking again.
* **You get a pageful of ads** — While this means we won’t get the FS from a typed search, we can still get them from voice searches, so this is okay.
* **Someone else has a FS** — Look at who has it and the question, if the question is “What’s the best type of lumber?” and it's written by lumberyard.com, no chance. Most other competitors, e.g., khanacademy, investopedia, wikipedia, we can beat it, although the rules regarding popularity and relatedness still apply.
* **There’s a video/selection of videos** — We can actually replace these with FSs, so don’t rule them out entirely. Essentially, treat them the same as the previous point.

Since Google is constantly changing how it presents search results, there is a chance that you will search for a question and get none of the above. If so, please send a message to the head of the FAQ project on Slack with the question you searched for.
