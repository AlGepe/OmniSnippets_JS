Symbols, equations and units
============================

Fortunately, Google is very good at reading out equations, symbols and units, so you should use all your m^^3^^, ℃ and ⅓ to your heart’s content. The only exception is for multiplication signs, please use × instead of \*. You are free to use ````` for equations as you usually would.

.. warning::
  Please don't put LaTeX-style formulas in FAQ answers, as they won't appear correctly on Google. Use :ref:`backticks<equations>` or bold text instead.
