============================

Fortunately, Google is very good at reading out equations, symbols and units, so you should use all your m<sup>3</sup>, ℃ and ⅓ to your heart’s content. The only exception is for multiplication signs, please use × instead of \*. You are free to use ````` and ``<code>`` for equations as you usually would.
