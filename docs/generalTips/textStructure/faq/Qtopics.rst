A note on calculator topics
===========================

You may have already realised that certain calculators are purpose built for these types of questions, with lots of examples and instructions, but other, e.g., health calculators, are not. Also, you may find **that the questions are all answered by the most trustworthy of sources**, e.g., the NHS. First, try to look at some of the **less popular questions**, you may find some inspiration there. You can always **search for different keywords**, too. 

If that still leaves you short, you can always **make up a few questions of your own**. Just try to think of what **people are likely to ask on the topic** and cater to them. They should still **try to relate to calculations and examples**, though. If, after all of that, you still need inspiration, just pick the questions youâ€™d expect to find in an FAQ, regardless of their chance of getting FSs & gFAQs.
