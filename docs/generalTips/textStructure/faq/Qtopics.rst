A note on calculator topics
===========================

As you start to look through SEMrush for questions, you'll notice that some calculators have loads of questions that are related to what Omni is good at. You'll then also find that some calculators, e.g., health calculators, are not. You may also find **that most questions are have FS by the most trustworthy of sources**, e.g., the NHS. 

First, try to look at some of the **less popular questions**, you may find some inspiration there. You can always **search for different keywords**, too. 

If that still leaves you short, you can always **make up a few questions of your own**. Some calculators don't have any specific questions, so just try to think of what **people are likely to ask on the topic** and cater to them. You can even make up an **interesting question** to discuss a little piece of cool knowledge on the topic. Please **put the interesting question at the top of the FAQ section**. 

When making up questions, you are still required to meet the one specific question and one "How do I..." guidelines, and interesting questions don't count towards either of these.
