A note on calculator topics
===========================

As you start to look through SEMrush for questions, you'll notice that some calculators have loads of questions that are related to what Omni is good at. You'll then also find that some calculators, e.g., health calculators, are not. You may also find **that most questions on SEMrush have FSs by the most trustworthy of sources**, e.g., the NHS. 

First, try to look at some of the **less popular questions**, you may find some inspiration there. You can always **search for different keywords**, too. If that still leaves you short, you can always **make up a few questions of your own**. Often, calculators don't have any specific questions in SEMrush, so just try to think of what **people are likely to ask on the topic** and cater to them.

Since you may know a lot about your topic, you are allowed to make up one **interesting question** to discuss a little piece of cool knowledge on the topic. This question doesn't need any SEO potential, but is there **for the readers enjoyment**. To make it prominent to users and google, please **put the interesting question at the top of the FAQ section**. You should also note that an interseting question, regardless of the answer type, doesn't count towards either the one "How do I..." or one specific question requirements.
