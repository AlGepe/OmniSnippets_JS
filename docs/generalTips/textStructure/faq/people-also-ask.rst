Google's "People also ask"
===========================

Another good place to look for FAQ questions is **google itself**. When you perform a search, if you scroll down a bit, you'll usually see a "People also ask" section. **This is a collection of questions that google's users actually search for.** What is also useful is that, as you click on questions to show their answer, **google will generate more related questions for you**. This is a good way of finding **specific example questions** if there are none on SEMrush, as well as **potential questions for less popular calculators**.

The first search you perform using this method should be **using the main keyword plus the word "calculator"**. This will ensure that the questions shown are initially related to what we do at Omni. Please then click through some of the questions to access more questions. If this fails to generate any promising leads, you can try other keywords. If you do choose a question, I would still google it separately as outlined elsewhere in this guide (for some reason, the answer shown when you click on the "People also ask" section is different to an actual google search).

The issue that presents itself is that google merely says that these questions are commonly searched for, without saying by how much. Therefore I recommend **analysing the questions yourself to judge how popular they are**. SEMrush can also help here. The questions should then be selected according to the popularity rules outlined elsewhere in this guide.
