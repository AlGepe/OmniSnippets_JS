Interesting questions
=====================

Because we should still add a bit of our Omni charm to this, feel free to create an interesting question. An interesting question is a question that you make up, and so has **little to no SEO potential**, but is either **something you know about the topic you’d like to explore**, or something you think people would find very interesting.

Here are a few examples:

* What would happen in a world without friction?
* How does light wavelength affect photosynthesis?
* Can identical twins be different heights?

The interesting question should be one of the **top 3 questions you write**, as we’d like these to be seen by people first when they google their query.
