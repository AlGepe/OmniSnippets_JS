After publication
=====================

After your tool is published, you will see it tagged with a new pink “FAQ” label, gain a new due date one week after publishing and see a link to a spreadsheet in the description. Once the deadline comes, please perform the appropriate FSs and gFAQs checks as below, record the data in the spreadsheet, and remove the label. Then that’s it, you’re all done!

Checking results
----------------

Please, check all results in **incognito mode**, as I’m pretty sure Google knows we work for Omni ;)

FS
----------------

This ones easy, just copy and paste all of your questions into the right-most column of the spreadsheet. FSs take many weeks to work, so this will enable me to quickly check them for FSs long after you've moved on from the tool.

gFAQ
----------------

Search for the main keyword, e.g., acceleration calculator, and find Omni's result. If Google changes its layout, i.e., adds “Overview” or “Formula” to a left hand panel, **do not click them**. You can however click to page 2 and 3 and so on of Google’s results if we are not on the first page (hopefully that’s not the case though). Record the **number** and **type** of gFAQs, if any. 


Rich results test
-----------------

A useful tool for double checking the FAQ on your calculator is **Google Rich Results Test**. Once you have saved your calculator, you can wait 5-10 mins (it can be up to an hour unfortunately) then copy and paste the calculator's url and test it.

You will see if your page is eligible for rich results (it should be, message me if its not) and, by clicking "Preview results", you can see what your gFAQs will look like. If you've used some funky formatting and are unsure if it'll display correctly, you can check here for certain.
