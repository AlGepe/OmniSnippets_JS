After publication
=====================

After your tool is published, you will see it tagged with a new pink “FAQ” label and there will be a link to a spreadsheet in the description. When you see this label appear, please perform the appropriate checks set out below, record the data in the spreadsheet, and remove the label. Then that’s it, you’re all done!

Checking results
----------------

Please, check all results in **incognito mode**, as I’m pretty sure Google knows we work for Omni ;)


gFAQ
----------------

Search for the main keyword, e.g., acceleration calculator, and find Omni's result. If Google changes its layout, i.e., adds “Overview” or “Formula” to a left hand panel, **do not click them**. You can however click to page 2 and 3 and so on of Google’s results if we are not on the first page (hopefully that’s not the case though). Record the **number** and **type** of gFAQs, if any. 

Data to be recorded
----------------

As well as the number of gFAQs, if any, two additional pieces of data are required on the spreadsheet. First, if you could please provide the types of answers that you have written in the appropriate column. In this case, if your answer has an ordered list/unordered list/table as well as a line of text or two, then please count it as an ordered list/unordered list/table. Secondly, if you could provide all of the questions that you answered to the right of the table, that would be greatly appreciated. 


Rich results test
-----------------

A useful tool for double checking the FAQ on your calculator is **Google Rich Results Test**. Once you have saved your calculator, you can wait 5-10 mins (it can be up to an hour unfortunately) then copy and paste the calculator's url and test it.

You will see if your page is eligible for rich results (it should be, message me if its not) and, by clicking "Preview results", you can see what your gFAQs will look like. If you've used some funky formatting and are unsure if it'll display correctly, you can check here for certain.
