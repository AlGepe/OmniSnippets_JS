Question length
===============

It seems that longer questions, **around the 6-9 words mark**, work best. Try to aim for this for most of your questions, but, of course, if you see the perfect question thatâ€™s 4 words, we can still get those. **I would not, however, go over the maximum of 13 words** - it's just too long.
