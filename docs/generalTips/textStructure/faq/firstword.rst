Question’s first word
=====================

Linked to what I’ve just said about :ref:`relatedness to Omni<relatednessToOmni>`, **certain question types (“How…”, “Can…”, etc) work better for us than others**. Here is a breakdown of the questions written by first word and their success:

   Table of questions by first word.

As you can see, the questions that suit us best begin with “How…”, followed by “What…”. These are **the primary question types you should be writing, because they fit Omni well**: “How do I calculate square roots?”, “What is the square root of 2?”. However, I would put a slight prioritization on "How" questions.

Many “How…” questions come in the form “How do I.../How do you.../How to…”. In this case, **please use “How do I…” over “How do you…” and "How to..."**, unless of course you see a question which is extremely popular beginning with “How do you/to…”.

This is not to say that you should write these question types exclusively, as you can see other words do see success and their data sizes are rather small, but **they should make up the bulk of your work**. If you see **a really interesting question** that works well with Omni that **begins with “Do…”**, by all means **go for it**, just make sure they **don't comprise more than half of all the questions** (unless you’re really struggling).
