Answers summary
===============

* Write whichever answer type is most fitting, but this should hopefully be **instructions** based on which questions work best.
* If you have a choice between different answers, then its (in order of preference) **Instructions > List > Paragraph > Table**.
* Paragraphs should be, ideally, **32-56 words** (176-305 characters), but no more than **84 words** or **413 characters** and give their answer ASAP with additional information given after.
* Ordered and unordered lists should be, ideally, **40-70 words** (224-395 characters) and **2-5 items** (maximum lengths **100 words**, 531 characters, **7 items**) and can be structured in several ways depending on what you want. Instructions should always begin with the imperative, be written in words and can have an introduction line.
* Tables should ideally have **2 columns** (no limit on rows).
* **Bold keywords** (especially keywords also in the question), answers, and table headers.
* No links, no images, no LaTeX (equation blocks or inline $$ $$ LaTeX) and a maximum of one emoji please!
