Word count
==========

Google likes its answers to be as brief and to the point as possible. Because of this, there are limits on word counts and the number of items in a list. Now, these limits are by no means hard - if you really have to go over them by a little bit, you can still get the FS. But you should do everything you can to avoid this.

* **Paragraphs** - Ideally 32-56 words and 176-305 characters, up to a suggested maximum of 84 words and 413 characters.
* **Ordered and unordered lists** - Ideally 40-70 words, 224-395 characters, and 2-5 items. The suggested maximums are 100 words, 531 characters and 7 items.
* **Table** â€” Ideally **2** columns, no limit on rows.
