Word count
==========

Google likes its answers to be as brief and to the point as possible. Because of this, there are limits on word counts and the number of items in a list. Now, these limits are by no means hard - if you really have to go over them by a little bit, you can still get the FS. But you should do everything you can to avoid this.

* **Paragraph** — Ideally **54-58** words, maximum **84** words or **370** characters.
* **Instructions/list** — Ideally **5-6** points and around **57** words total, maximum **8** points and **137** words total.
* **Table** — Ideally **2** columns, no limit on rows.
