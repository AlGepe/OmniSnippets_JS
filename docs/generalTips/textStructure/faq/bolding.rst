Bolding
--------------------

You’re all very familiar with bolding, so it shouldn’t be too much of an issue. You should always bold keywords (particularly those that are in the question itself), the answer to the question in a paragraph, the imperative in instructions, the word before the hyphen in a list, and the headings in a table. As always, don’t bold everything!
