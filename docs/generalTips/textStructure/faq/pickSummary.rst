Picking questions summary
=========================

* Use **SEMrush and Google** to pick appropriate questions.
* You can **fiddle with questions** slightly to better suit our needs.
* If you are really struggling to find questions related to calculations, **use other keywords**. If that still doesnâ€™t work, you can write a few of your own.
* You can **add an interesting question** as one of the first three questions.
* Its a good idea to **google your question** before you start writing your answer.
