Should all headings now be FAQs?
-------------------------

Try to avoid having all headings in the text as FAQs, as there are plenty of other keywords deserving of headings for SEO reasons and having just questions will break up the flow of the text. Try to think of this as “Ah, I can easily turn this section into an FAQ”, as opposed to “How do I make every heading an FAQ?”. 

The exception to this is converter calculators, where you may really struggle to write a load of text. In this case, it’s appropriate to have every heading as a question because it might help you find enough to write about to get you over the 500 words.
