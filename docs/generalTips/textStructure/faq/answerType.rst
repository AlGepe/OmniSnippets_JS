Answer type
===========

There are four ways you can write your answer, as a:

* Paragraph;
* Ordered list (a set of instructions);
* Unordered list; and
* Table. 

In general, we get the most FSs when our answers are written as instructions. This is because the questions that need instructions are also those that are the most related to Omni. For example, “How do I calculate a 10 % discount?” would require you to write a simple guide as an ordered list. You should therefore **be prepared to write a lot of instructions**.

You should however always choose the most relevant answer type to the question:

* **Instructions** — Where a step by-step guide is needed, e.g., “How do I find the midpoint of a triangle?”
* **List** — Often where you would use a paragraph, but would like to present the information succinctly, e.g., “What are the types of discount?”
* **Table** — Where you want to present a lot of numerical information quickly, e.g., “How much does a car depreciate per year?”
* **Paragraph** — Every other occurrance where the above answers don't fit. You provide the answer in full sentences. Examples include “Do you round midpoints?” or “What is the midpoint of 0 and 5?”.

It is often the case that you could answer the question with any number of the answer types. In this case, **lists, either ordered or unordered, take priority**. This is because google likes information shown in lists the most. The lowest priority is a table, as it's not very useful for voice searches. The overall priority is therefore **Instruction > List > Paragraph > Table**.

.. tip::
  Remember, if some steps have to be in a specific order, then use an ordered list. If not, an unordered list will do.

You can combine both types of list, e.g. `How do I calculate a goat's due date? <https://www.omnicalculator.com/biology/goat-gestation#faq>`_ . If you do so, please count each ordered and unordered item towards the item total (so there are 6 items in the example).
