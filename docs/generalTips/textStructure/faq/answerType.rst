Answer type
===========

There are four main ways you can write your answer, as a:
* Paragraph;
* Ordered list (a set of instructions);
* Unordered list; and
* Table. 

In general, instructions performed the best. This is because the questions that need instructions are also those that are the most related to Omni. For example, “How do I calculate a 10 % discount?” would require you to write a simple guide as an ordered list. You should therefore **be prepared to write a lot of instructions**.

You should however always choose the most relevant answer type to the question:

* **Paragraph** — Where full sentences are required, such as “Do you round midpoints?” or questions that need an immediate answer, e.g., “What is the midpoint of 0 and 5?”.
* **Instructions** — Where a step by-step guide is needed, e.g., “How do I find the midpoint of a triangle?”
* **List** — Often where you would use a paragraph, but would like to present the information succinctly, e.g., “What are the types of discount?”
* **Table** — Where you want to present a lot of numerical information quickly, e.g., “How much does a car depreciate per year?”

It is often the case that your answer could be any of the types. In this case, **lists, either ordered or unordered, take priority**. This is because google likes information shown in lists the most. The lowest priority is a table, as it's not very useful for voice searches. The overall priority is therefore **Instruction > List > Paragraph > Table**.

Tip

Remember, if some steps have to be in a specific order, then use an ordered list. If not, an unordered list will do.

You can combine both types of list, e.g.
