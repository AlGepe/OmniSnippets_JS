Choosing keywords
=================

All text written in the FAQ section counts towards both your **word count** and **keyword saturation**. 

In terms of keyword priority, we cannot neglect the regular keyword as the majority of our traffic is still from typed searches. Please choose your keywords as you usually would and from this choose **at least 4 questions**, but preferably 5-7, that complement those keywords and abide by the FAQ guidelines set out above.

Some keywords are perfect for questions, e.g., “How to find the volume of a cylinder”, in which case don’t worry about changing it to “How do I…”, just add a question mark at the end, write an FAQ, and think about integrating it into your text as you would normally (see the :ref:`::qa:x:: <faqReferencingFAQinMainText>` section for more information).

If the keyword is not perfect English, e.g., “How calculate dog age", **you can still turn this into a question**, just write out the question in proper English and count it towards your keyword saturation, even if BB doesn’t compute it as so (it may be beneficial to add a note to your reviewer that you’ve had to do this and have met your proper keyword saturation).

I **would not rely** on this method exclusively though, as a) you may not get enough keywords that lend themselves to questions and b) these keywords tend to be very competitive and about half of your questions should be less competitive. You can find a whole load of question in SEM rush by clicking the “Questions” button at the top of the result.
