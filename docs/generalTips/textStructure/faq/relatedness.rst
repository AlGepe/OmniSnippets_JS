While this is unfortunately not an easily quantifiable variable, there are some guidelines to follow. Questions that are related to **how to do things, calculations, specific examples and where a specific answer is required** are all extremely desirable because Google trusts us to be good suppliers of this kind of material. For example, the question “How do you calculate wavelength from wavenumber?” is better than “What colour is the longest visible wavelength?”, even though the latter is concerned with science as well. 

To better illustrate this point, here is a list of questions that have both FS and gFAQs:

* How do you find the antilog of a number?
* What is the midpoint of 30 and 60?
* How do I calculate a 30% margin?
* Can basis points be negative?

And here are some that didn’t make the cut:

* What is a typical commission?
* Does a keto diet affect your RMR?
* Are all right triangles similar?
* What does fat do for your body?

**You should try to incorporate questions that prime themselves for instructions**, “How do I calculate discount percentage?”, and those that are looking for **a specific answer to a common problem**, “What is a 10 % discount on $45?”. The exact ratio of this mixture will depend on what people search for, which will be discussed in the “How to find questions” section, but you should always try to write some of each.
