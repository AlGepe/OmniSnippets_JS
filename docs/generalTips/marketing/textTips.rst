Text tips
=====================

The main difference between an normal calculator SEO text and a marketing text is, well, the focus we put on SEO. In short, if you're writing a marketing text, **you don't care about the keywords or the SEO checker**. Thus, you have more freedom in writing; the text can be more natural, more creative, more funny.

We've gathered some of the best practices for writing marketing calculator texts. Before you read them, I recommend you check out our best marketing texts such as the `Christmas tree calculator <https://www.omnicalculator.com/other/christmas-tree>`_, `Pay gap calculator <https://www.omnicalculator.com/other/pay-gap-us>`_ or the `Plastic footprint calculator <https://www.omnicalculator.com/ecology/plastic-footprint>`_.

**Eye-catching headlines are a must.** You don't have to stuff keywords into the headlines, so you can make each section count by giving it an interesting headline.

**The lead is the most important part of the text**, as it can convince journalists to write about the tool. It must include:

* Why we need to talk about it now â€” mention dates when possible;
* Why itâ€™s important for millions of people â€” mention number of people affected; and
* Why did we create the tool â€” how is it helpful?


**Make sure the text answers these questions:**

* Why this topic is important for people now â€” in the lead;
* Why the tool is useful/helpful for people â€” in the lead;
* How the tool works;
* How can we apply it in our lives (tips); and
* Bonus: If possible, include a fun factor for readers.


**Keep the tone light, optimistic, and upbeat.** If it's possible to make it funny, make it funny. If not, try to convey the message of how much we **help you** and make your life wonderful. Don't focus on what sucks. If the calculator is only about what sucks (e.g. how smoking reduces your lifetime), **give some hands-on advice** about what the user can do about it and how he can change the world for the better.

**Be mindful of your audience.** We strive to make a tool that can be used universally, but in rare cases, such as when our target audience are just in the US, UK, etc., remember to use examples and data from that region.

**Make sure that it is understandable for everyone.** Imagine that a person without a mathematical mind or scientific expertise will read it. Use Grammarly to check its level of difficulty. We aim for text that is understandable for those 13-14 years old.

**Use visuals.** Pictures, GIFs, videos (relevant ones!), emojis â€” they all make the text more attractive.

**Keep it short and sweet.** Try not to go over **1500 words** â€” people won't read it.

**Lastly, brace yourself for feedback.** This calculator might be your baby, but remember that you are creating it to help others. Hence, you might receive feedback and changes that you might not agree with. Donâ€™t take it personally! **Trust the Marketing Teamâ„¢** ðŸ˜Š They just want whatâ€™s best for your baby. And of course, **theyâ€™re open to your feedback too!**

Making marketing graphics (simple guidelines)
---------------------------------------------

Following these simple guidelines, you can ensure our graphics look unique compared to our competition and are easily identifiable as Omniâ€™s graphics.

1. We use `this logo <https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jedzqji5fXavTLHVDFFRz0Iok3IV_Wfz?usp=sharing>`_ in all our graphics which goes in the bottom-right corner.
2. In case the image goes inside the calculator section, you donâ€™t need to add a logo.
3. We always use `Raleway Font <https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway>`_ for all our graphics, itâ€™s part of Omniâ€™s Brand identity.
4. Try using **vector-based** graphics to bring uniformity to our style.
5. Make sure the tone and background color of the graphic blends well with the **theme color of the calculator category**. For example, physics has dark pink, food has blue, everyday-life might have orangeâ€¦ etc.
