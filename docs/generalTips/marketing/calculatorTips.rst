Calculator tips
=====================

We've gathered some of the best practices for creating a marketing calculator. Before you read them, I recommend you check out our best marketing calculators such as the `Christmas tree calculator <https://www.omnicalculator.com/other/christmas-tree>`_, `Pay gap calculator <https://www.omnicalculator.com/other/pay-gap-us>`_ or the `Plastic footprint calculator <https://www.omnicalculator.com/ecology/plastic-footprint>`_.

Remember that we are building this tool in order to **help as many people as we can**.  Hence, you may need to **simplify** the calculator and the text as much as needed. And of course, be ready to receive feedback from the Marketing Teamâ„¢. ðŸ˜‰

**Add a brief introduction at the top of the calculator**

This will give the user an idea of what the tool is for, and why itâ€™s important (or fun) to use. For examples, check out `Social Distancing <https://www.omnicalculator.com/health/social-distancing>`_, `Alien Civilization <https://www.omnicalculator.com/physics/alien-civilization>`_, and `Second Stimulus Check <https://www.omnicalculator.com/finance/stimulus-heroes>`_.
  
**Users must understand the input values**

You need to create the calculator in a way that it will be **absolutely intuitive for an average person**, and the input values are things that the user knows.

For example, the users will know how often they drink coffee and whether it's a latte or an espresso, but they won't know how much caffeine they consume. They will know the city in which they live, but **not** the GPS coordinates.

**Be mindful of the target audience**

For example, if the main target is from the US, use imperial units as default.
  
**The result must have an interpretation**

It's not enough that you tell the user they generate 80 kg of plastic per year, they need to know whether it's a **good or bad result**. This interpretation should ideally **appear in the calculator itself** because not everyone reads the text.

If itâ€™s applicable, you may **add some tips** in relation with the results so that the users know how to apply it to their lives. Basically, we are trying to sell the story with these calculators â€” not just the science behind the numbers.
