=================================================

**What is a marketing calculator?**

A marketing calculator is a calculator that people don’t search for. Instead, they find it by reading articles journalists write and post. Therefore, our primary audience here are journalists. They’re the ones we need to convince our tool is great!

**Why do we promote our calculators?**
 
**We want to:**

* Increase **traffic** to our website;
* Build **links** to our website; and
* Build **credibility** and authority of our website.

**How do we choose ideas for our new marketing calculators?**

**Important factors:**


1. **Good timing** — journalists want to write hot and trending stories.
2. **Novel/unique idea** — journalists want to write articles about something that is new and unique.
3. **Topics:** entertaining and science topics are most wanted (The Vampire Apocalypse Calculator). We want to create more physics experiments related calculators like: The Flat vs. Round Earth Calculator or The Helium Balloons Calculator. We want to avoid controversial topics like; sex, alcohol, etc.
4. **Large but well targeted audience** — journalists want to write articles about topics that are important for millions of their readers.
5. **How the tool works** — it should give you an individual and simple solution/exact answer to a common problem that everyone (in the target group) has.
6. **Nice to have:** credibility/expertise in that field.
