Adding sources to calculators
=============================

In the *Details* section of the edit calculator page on BB, you can add the sources you've used to create your calculator. It is essential for SEO purposes to get authority and credibility. But it's for sure important for our users too üòÄ

Below are guidelines for what type of sources are good and bad, and when to add them.

.. note::
  For specifics on how to add sources and their formatting, see the :ref:`Sources<detailsSources>` section of the *Details* page of this edit calculator section.

What is our goal?
-----------------

We want to look credible and trustworthy from the very moment somebody enters the website ‚Äì the first impression is the last impression. Part of the websites' quality ranking is done manually by Search Quality Raters ‚Äì we should convince them that you are the experts in the field, and Omni is a trustworthy page. 

What are good sources (from best ones)? ‚úÖ
------------------------------------------

* **Most recommended:** peer-reviewed research papers;
* Databases, trustworthy statistics (e.g., Eurostat, US surveys);
* Other articles, reports;
* Credible websites (governmental, educational, universities, organizations with authority in the field);
* Press release from a credible, well-known media outlet (CNN, New York Times, Discovery Channel, etc.); and
* Books (if possible, avoid books with very generic, wide scope of topics, e.g., ‚ÄúMathematical Formulas for Economists‚Äù).

What is not a good reference (in general)? ‚ùå
---------------------------------------------

* Blog posts;
* Random websites;
* Forums, Quora, Reddit, etc.;
* Less known / not-so-credible media outlets (Fox News, The Sun, etc.); and
* Wikipedia, as it is a collection of sources rather than a source itself. Try to find the primary source in Wikipedia's reference list.


Guidelines depending on the category of the tool
------------------------------------------------

Health and Finance calculators
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These two categories are really important in the eyes of Google, and the content may be ranked differently than in other fields. They fall within the broad category of ‚ÄúYour money or your life‚Äù (YMYL) pages, potentially influencing a person's future happiness, health, financial stability, or safety.

We need to focus here on raising our authority, showing Google we know what we're writing about and that we're experts in that field. 

According to Google's `Quality Raters Guidelines <https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/guidelines.raterhub.com/pl//searchqualityevaluatorguidelines.pdf>`_, we'll especially need here high expertise, authoritativeness, and trustworthiness (E-A-T):

* *High E-A-T medical advice should be written or produced by people or organizations with appropriate medical expertise or accreditation. High E-A-T medical advice or information should be written or produced in a professional style and should be edited, reviewed, and updated on a regular basis.*
* *High E-A-T financial advice, legal advice, tax advice, etc., should come from trustworthy sources and be maintained and updated regularly.*

What does it mean for Health and Finance categories in Omni? It's essential for us to:

* Have a **medical doctor/finance expert as a coauthor of the tool**, preferable as the first author (or at least a reviewer);
* Add credible sources to such tools whenever possible; and
* Keep the tools and articles **updated** as much as possible (tax calculators updated yearly, etc.).

Calculators from all the other categories
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* As a rule of thumb, **add sources every time your calculator wouldn't exist or would work differently** without that specific reference. For example, the meat footprint calculator is based mainly on one article from Science; the bladder volume calculator uses two formulas from research papers. Those are necessary references to add in the ‚ÄúSources‚Äù section. 
* You can add the references you're using in the text, but **only the most important ones**. Remember that we don't want to add all external links from the article into the ‚ÄúSources‚Äù section ‚Äì only those which were used directly to create the tool or are a crucial part of the information used in your article.

**It's OKAY not to have sources**, so don't force it. Probably most of our calculators won't need them.
