CustomJs (not in Engine v2 yet)
===============================

**NOT YET IMPLEMENTED IN Engine v2!**

As well as equations to produce output in the calculator, you can also use JavaScript to display text, images, custom equations, process data, define value setters, etc.

Enter your JavaScript code in this section of the calculator. After a few seconds, the changes you make will be reflected in the calculator :ref:`preview <calculatorPreview>`.

For full documentation on CustomJS, please see the :ref:`CustomJS section <CustomJsIntro>` of this handbook.
