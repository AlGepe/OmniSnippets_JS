Omni Calculator's handbook for calculatoriansÂ©
=================================================

The following handbook aims to **gather all the knowledge** about the tools that calculatorians can use at Omni Calculator. We hope this guide would become a precious source of information that you can revisit whenever you have doubts about the calculator's engine, text writing, and any other Omni-related stuff.

The handbook was created by Dominik, Jack, Steve, and Wojtek, who shared the experience they gained during the work at Omni Calculator as calculatorians, reviewers, or proofreaders. We will update it regularly with all new features that come out at Omni Calculator with time. Any **feedback or requests** for new content should be directed to ..., the current editor of this guide. Enjoy the handbook!
