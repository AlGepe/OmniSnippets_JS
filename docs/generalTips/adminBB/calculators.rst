Calculators
=====================

The calculators tab is the **default one** when logging into `adminBB
<https://www.omnicalculator.com/adminbb>`__. You can create a new calculator or find any existing one by its name or ID, go to its edit page, or check some of its basic information.

The upper panel of the edit calculator page contains the following items, from left to right:

* **Three-bar hamburger menu** ‚Äî Access other parts of adminBB.
* **Omni logo** and **Calculators** ‚Äî The link to the current page, you can use it as a refresh button üîÑ.
* **Add calculator** ‚Äî Creates a new calculator and takes you there.


Search panel
------------

You can search a calculator by its **name** or **ID**:

* Typing a **string** returns all the calculators with this phrase in their names (it can also be a part of the word, not necessarily an exact match).
* Typing a **number** returns only the calculator with that ID (if it exists).

    The example of using the search panel. See that names with words containing the phrase **car**, e.g. **carrier**, show up as well.

Filters
-------

By defining some of these filters you can limit the search results depending on your needs:

* **Is published** ‚Äî *Yes* shows published calculators, *No* shows unpublished ones.
* **Purpose** ‚Äî You can choose between *production*, *non production*, *temporary*, or *unassigned*. You can check these descriptions :ref:`here <detailsPurpose>`.  
* **Categories** ‚Äî Shows calculators within a chosen category.
* **Author** ‚Äî Shows calculators by the selected author. 
* **Redundant** ‚Äî *Yes* shows :ref:`redundant  <detailsParentRedundantCalc>` calculators, *No* shows all the others.
* **Faq count** ‚Äî Shows calculators with FAQs within given range.
* **Updated at** ‚Äî Shows calculators which were updated between the given dates.
* **Published at** ‚Äî Shows calculators published between the given dates.

Selecting multiple options for one field shows every calculator that matches **at least one of them**. For instance, if you choose two authors, you'll see **all** of their calculators - they don't have to be co-authors of any üòâ.

Columns
-------

Here you can decide which calculators' attributes you want to see. **Name** is always visible and you can choose which of the remaining ones are important for you. These are:

* Slug;
* ID;
* Category;
* Subcategory;
* Authors;
* Faq count;
* Created;
* Updated; and
* Published.

.. note::
  You can always come back to *default* settings by pressing **Reset** button.

    The calculator's clickable attributes on adminBB

There are a few clickable elements that let you interact with a calculator:

* **Calculator's name** ‚Äî A link to the :ref:`calculator's edit page <editCalculator>`.
* **Paragraph symbol** ‚Äî A link to the :ref:`calculator's text edit page <editCalculatorText>`.
* **Internet Explorer symbol** ‚Äî A link to the :ref:`calculator's web page <calculatorPage>`.
* **Trash bin icon** üóëÔ∏è ‚Äî Lets you **remove the calculator**. To do so, you need to confirm the action by entering the calculator's slug.

.. warning::
  **DO NOT delete published calculators!** You may want to remove one of those you've started but you're no longer working on. However, it's usually safer to simply change its purpose to **temporary** as these will disappear sometime in the future.
