Calculators
=====================

Calculators tab is the **default one** when logging to `adminBB
<https://www.omnicalculator.com/adminbb>`__. You can create a new calculator or find any existing one by its name or id, go to its edit page, or check some of the basic characteristics.

The upper panel of the edit calculator page contains the following items on the left, from left to right:

* **Three-bar hamburger menu** — access other parts of adminBB.
* **Omni logo** and **Calculators** — the link to the current page, you can use it as a refresh button 🔄.
* **Add calculator** — takes you to a new calculator page.


Search panel
----

You can search a calculator by the **name** or **id**:

* Typing a **string** returns all the calculators with this phrase in their names (it can also be a part of the word, not necessary the exact match).
* Typing a **number** returns only the calculator with this id (if only it exist).

Filters
----

By defininig some of these filters you can limit the search results depending on your needs:

* **Is published** — *Yes* shows published calculators, *No* shows unpublished ones.
* **Purpose** — you can choose between *production*, *non production*, *temporary*, or *unassigned*. You can check the descriptions `here  <https://omnigeneraltips.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generalTips/calculatorStructure/details.html#purpose>`__.  
* **Categories** — shows calculators within chosen category.
* **Author** — shows calculators of selected author. 
* **Redundant** — *Yes* shows `redundant  <https://omnigeneraltips.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generalTips/calculatorStructure/details.html#parent-of-redundant-calculator>`_ calculators, *No* shows all the others.
* **Faq count** — shows calculators with FAQs in given range.
* **Updated at** — shows calculators which were updated between given dates.
* **Published at** — shows calculators published between given dates.

Selecting multiple options for one field shows every calculator that matches **at least one of them**. For instance, if you choose two authors, you'll see **all** of their calculators - they don't have to be co-authors of any 😉.

Columns

Here you can decide which calculators' attributes you want to see. **Name** is always visible and you can choose which of the remaining ones are important for you. These are:

* Slug;
* Id;
* Category;
* Subcategory;
* Authors;
* Faq count;
* Created;
* Updated; and
* Published.

.. note::
  You can always come back to *default* setting by pressing **Reset** button.

    The calculator's clickable attributes on adminBB

There are a few clickable elements that let you interact with a calculator:

* **Calculator's name** — a link to  `calculator's edit page <https://omnigeneraltips.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generalTips/calculatorStructure/intro.html>`__; 
* **Paragraph symbol** — a link to  `calculator's text edit page <https://omnigeneraltips.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generalTips/textStructure/editCalculatorText/intro.html>`__; 
* **Internet Explorer symbol** — a link to  `calculator's web page <https://omnigeneraltips.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generalTips/calculatorPage/intro.html>`__; 
* **Trash bin icon** 🗑️ — lets you **remove the calculator**. To do so, you need to confirm the action by entering the calculator's slug.

.. warning::
  **DO NOT delete published calculators!** You may want to remove one of those you've started but you're no longer working on. However, it's usually safer to simply change it's purpose to **temporary** as these will disapear sometime in the future.
