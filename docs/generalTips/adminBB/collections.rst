Collections
=====================

Collections help us **group calculators** that are closely **related thematically**. They don't need to be of the same category. We usually create collections for marketing purposes. 

A few of **other calculators from the same collection display below the calculator**. If the calculator doesn't belong to any collection, you can see a set of calculators from the same (sub)category by default.

    The calculators from "Bike calculators" collection show up below speed calculator. See that speed belongs to "Everyday life" category, while bike size is the one of "Sports"


.. note::
  A calculator can belong to **more than one collection**.
