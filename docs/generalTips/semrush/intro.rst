Keywords research
=================================================

The traffic at our calculators comes mainly from three sources:

- **Search engines** (e.g., Google) - that's the primary source of traffic. People are looking for sites that solve their specific inquires.
- **Links** - other sites sometimes link to our tools, which are usually marketing calculators.
- **Direct traffic** - that's a situation when people directly input the *www* address in a browser.

The first source comprises over **90% of incoming traffic**, so we want to be as high in search engine results as possible. Google is the most popular one with many available tools for traffic analysis, so we focus our efforts to be attractive for it.

Google decides whether to show our sites in top results by checking if the content we offer answers the user's request. It does it in terms of factors, including **keywords**. If the site contains frequently searched keywords, there is a high probability of finding what they are looking for.

We build our calculators in a way to improve our visibility on search engines, the so-called search engine optimization (SEO). There are plenty of available tools that we can use to analyze Google traffic, e.g., SEMrush or Google Analytics.

**SEMrush** is a powerful tool that tells how frequently people are looking for specific keywords recently. In contrast, **Google Analytics** allows comparing the traffic between two or more keywords over a more extended period.

It also a good idea to **check the websites of our competitors**, which are at the top of Google results, to see which keywords they are using and what features they offer.
