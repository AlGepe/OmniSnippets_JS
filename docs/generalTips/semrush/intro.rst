Keywords research
=================================================

The traffic at our calculators comes mostly from three sources:

- **search engines** (e.g., Google) - that's the main source of traffic. People are looking for sites that solve specific problems.
- **links** - other sites links to our tools, which are usually marketing calculators.
- **direct traffic** - that's a situation when people directly input the *www* adress in a browser

The first source comprises over 90% of incoming traffic, so we want to be as high in search engines results as possible. Google is the most common search engine with many available tools for analyzing the traffic. For that reason, we focus our efforts to be attractive for it.
