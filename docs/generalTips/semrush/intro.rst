Keywords research
=================================================

The traffic at our calculators comes mostly from three sources:

- **search engines** (e.g., Google) - that's the main source of traffic. People are looking for sites that solve specific problems.
- **links** - other sites links to our tools, which are usually marketing calculators.
- **direct traffic** - that's a situation when people directly input the *www* adress in a browser

The first source comprises over 90% of incoming traffic, so we want to be as high in search engines results as possible. Google is the most common search engine with many available tools for analyzing the traffic. For that reason, we focus our efforts to be attractive for it.

Google decides whether to show our sites in top results by checking if the content answers the user's request. It does it in terms of many of many factors including **keywords**. If the site contains frequently searched keywords, then there is high probability that users would find what they are looking for.

We build our calculators in a way to improve the visibility on search engines, so-called search engine optimization (SEO). As we said, there are many available tools that we can use to analyze Google traffic, e.g., SEMrush or Google Analytics. **SEMrush** is a powerful tool that tells how frequently people are looking for specific keywords recently, whereas Google Analytics allows to compare the traffic between keywords over longer period. Since in Omni Calculator we primarily use the former one, in the following article we focus on the description of SEMrush possibilities.
