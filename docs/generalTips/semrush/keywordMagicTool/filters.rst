    The Keyword Magic Tool in SEMrush: filters.
    
The most popular topics often comprise thousands of keywords to choose from. To make it easier to navigate within them, SEMrush provides filters that may help find most suitable keywords. Calculatorians may find three of them especially helpful:

- **filter by volume** - if you're looking for Related keywords that are sorted by the "Related %" metric, then using this filter let you get rid of low-traffic keywords
- **include keywords** - specify which words should listed keywords contain. You can use Broad match (word variations) or Exact match, and decide whether keywords should contain all words provided or any of input words. This filter may save a day when your list of keywords is extremely long.
- **exclude keywords** - the idea is the same as of include keywords filter, but this time you forbid certain words in keywords. It is useful when keywords have multiple meanings and you want to exclude one, or when keywords are repeating hundreds of times with one word. For example, "square root" has 100,000 keywords, many of them being in the form "square root of x". Exclude the word "of", and the list becomes two times shorter with more diverse keywords.
