    The Keyword Magic Tool in SEMrush: filters.
    
The most popular topics often comprise thousands of keywords to choose from. To make it easier to navigate within them, SEMrush provides **filters** that may help find the most suitable keywords. Calculatorians may find three of them especially helpful:

- **filter by volume** - if you're looking for Related keywords that are sorted by the "Related %" metric, then using this filter let you get rid of low-traffic keywords
- **include keywords** - specify which words should found keywords contain. You can use Broad match mode, which allows word variations, or Exact match mode (add a word in the square brackets). You can also decide whether keywords should contain all the words you provided or any (at least one) input word. This filter may save the day when your list of keywords is extremely long.
- **exclude keywords** - the idea is the same as the include keywords filter, but this time you forbid certain words in keywords. It is useful when keywords have multiple meanings and you want to exclude one or when similar keywords repeat hundreds of times. For example, "square root" has 100,000 keywords, many of them being in the form "square root of x". Exclude the word "of", and the list becomes two times shorter with more diverse keywords.

.. tip::
  To be sure you won't miss good keywords, prepare the list of relevant words and use the *include keywords* filter in SEMrush with *Any keywords* option. Below is an example of such a list that you can copy-paste into the SEMrush. However, be sure to check other phrases as well! Maybe you will find some more interesting keywords which we haven't included here.
