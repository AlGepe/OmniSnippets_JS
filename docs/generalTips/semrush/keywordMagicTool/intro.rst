In Omni Calculator, we use SEMrush for the United States only and assume other languages to have similar corresponding keywords' traffic. SEMrush offers at least three features that might be helpful for calculatorians:

- **Keyword Overview** - the detailed analysis of a single keyword. The most important metric is **volume** which is the average number of monthly searches. You can quickly access it using the top search bar.
- **Keyword Magic Tool** - the analysis and search engine for keywords. That's the best way to find keywords for certain calculators.
- **Keyword Gap** - allows the comparison between us and competitors. Our Masterminders team use it to find ideas for the new calculators by looking at missing keywords. 

.. tip::
  The volume of the keywords is an average value that might evolve with time. If you have two keywords with similar traffic and you're not sure how you should name the calculator, using different tools, e.g., Google Trends, might make your decision easier.
