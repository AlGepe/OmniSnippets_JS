    The Keyword Magic Tool in SEMrush: Related option.
    
The related keywords option returns a list of keywords that are similar to or are often used with your keyword. It is **recommended to check this feature**, as it might provide completely different keywords that are actually stronly related to your topic. 

The most common situation when *Related* option becomes handy is an alternative name of the problem you describe. For example, for the phrase "mortgage calculator", you can find "home loan calculator" which means the same, but it seems some users prefer to use this term instead.

.. tip:
  The list of related keywords is sorted by relatedness (Related %) by default. Since we're looking for high-traffic keywords, it is a good idea to **sort the list by volume**. You may find some totally unrelated keywords, but there is also a higher chance of finding interesting keywords with high traffic.
