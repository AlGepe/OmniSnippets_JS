.. _keywordRelevant:

The most relevant keywords for Omni
===================================

SEMrush may provide large lists of keywords to choose from, but you cannot use them all. Which should you pick then? There are two main criteria that might help you to decide:

- **Relatively high volume** — The more people searching for the keyword, the better, but there is no absolute lower limit for the volume. Instead, look at the relative value, e.g., down to 10% of the main keyword. We create calculators with a keyword volume of 20,000 as well as 200. For the former, 20 volume keywords would be probably a bad idea, but it would actually be a good keyword for the latter. Still, the criterion of 10% is not strict and highly depends on the number of available keywords. 

- **Relevance to Omni Calculators** — We usually cannot compete with huge databases of information like Wikipedia for rather generic keywords. Our calculators focus rather on solving **specific problems** that users struggle with. Ask yourself if the tool and article you're creating can help with a problem from a keyword and, if yes, then you should probably pick up this keyword. In the case of keywords for an :ref:`FAQ section <faqGuide>`, there are some additional criteria, but there is a separate guide for it.

.. note:: 
  For example, you won't find us in the top 10 Google results for the phrase "acceleration". However, suppose you type in "acceleration calculator", which is a **very specific keyword**. In that case, we're the first one, and for "acceleration formula" or "how to find acceleration" that are more general but **still specific keywords**, we're in the top 3 results.
  
It would be best if you avoided keywords that our calculators cannot answer. These can be phrases asking about **real-time data**, e.g., the current temperature or currency conversion. Another kind of keywords you shouldn't use are those which ask for **specific products**, e.g., trademarked drugs or construction material.

.. rubric:: Examples of good keywords:

- Acceleration **formula**
- Mortgage **definition**
- Ideal weight **equation**
- BMI **meaning**
- **Unit** of pressure
- Velocity **graph**
- Sock size **chart**
- Dividing exponents **example**
- **How to find** absolute value
- **What is** margin of safety
- **How to calculate** future value
- Square root **of 2**


.. rubric:: Examples of bad keywords:

- Velocity (too general)
- Dividend synonym (we aren't a dictionary)
- Acceleration clause (unrelated to the main topic)
- Quilting fabric (we're not a shop)
- Best weight loss pills (trademarked products)
