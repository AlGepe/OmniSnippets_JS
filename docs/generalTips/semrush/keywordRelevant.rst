.. _keywordRelevant:
The most relevant keywords
=====================

SEMrush often provide large lists of keywords to choose from, but we cannot use them all. Which should we pick then? There are two main criteria that might help you to decide:

- **relatively high volume** - the more people searching for the keyword the better, but there is no absolute lower limit for the volume. Instead, look at the relative value, e.g., down to 10% of the main keyword. We create calculators with keywords having 20,000 volume as well as 200. For the former, 20 volume keyword would be terrible idea, but for the latter, it would be actually a good keyword. Still, the criterion of 10% is not strict and highly depends on the number of available keywords. 

- **relevance to Omni Calculators** - we usually cannot compete with huge databases of informations like Wikipedia for too general keywords. Our calculators focus rather on solving **certain problems** that users struggle with. Ask yourself if the tool and article you're creating can help with a problem from a keyword, and if yes, then you should probably pick up this keyword. In case of keywords for an FAQ section, there are some extra criteria, but we prepared a seperate guide for it.

.. note:: 
  For example, you won't find us in top 10 Google results for the phrase "acceleration". However, if you type in "acceleration calculator" (very specific keyword), we're the first one and for "acceleration formula" or "how to find acceleration" (more general but still specific keywords) we're in top 3 results.
  
You should avoid keywords that our calculators cannot answer. These can be phrases asking about **real time data**, e.g., the current temperature or currency conversion. Another kind of keywords you shouldn't use are these which ask for **specific products**, e.g., trademarked drugs or construction material.

.. rubric:: Examples of good keywords

- acceleration **formula**
- mortgage **definition**
- ideal weight **equation**
- BMI **meaning**
- **unit** of pressure
- velocity **graph**
- sock size **chart**
- dividing exponents **example**
- **how to find** absolute value
- **what is** margin of safety
- **how to calculate** future value


.. rubric:: Examples of bad keywords

- velocity (too general)
- dividend synonym (we aren't a dictionary)
- acceleration clause (unrelated to the main topic)
- quilting fabric (we're not a shop)
- best weight loss pills (trademarked products)

.. tip::
  To be sure you won't miss good keywords, prepare the list of relevant words and use the *include keywords* filter in SEMrush with *Any keywords* option. Below is an example of such a list that you can copy-paste into the SEMrush: [formula]\[definition]\[equation] [meaning] [unit] [graph] [chart] [example] [how to find] [calculate] [calculator] [what is]. However, be sure to check other phrases as well! Maybe you will find some more interesting keywords which we haven't included here.
