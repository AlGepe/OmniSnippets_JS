Guide to Bitwarden
==================

What is Bitwarden?
------------------

Bitwarden is an open-source password management service that stores passwords and secrets in encrypted vaults. It is accessible on various platforms, such as Windows, MacOS, iOS, and Android. It also has Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox browser extensions. At Omni, we will be using it to store and access passwords to common-use accounts.

Downloading Bitwarden
---------------------

You can download Bitwarden as:

* Android app from `Play Store <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.x8bit.bitwarden>`_;
* Browser Extensions for `Firefox <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/bitwarden-password-manager/>`_ and `Chrome <https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bitwarden-free-password-m/nngceckbapebfimnlniiiahkandclblb>`_; and
* iOS app from `App Store <https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bitwarden-password-manager/id1137397744>`_.

How to use Bitwarden?
---------------------

You'll receive an email invite to join the organization and your team. Click on the invite link to:
Create an account; and 
Set a master password (make it long and not a password you use somewhere else). 
Once you log in and are in the vault, you'll have access to the passwords to the common accounts used by your teams. 

You can download the **browser extension to autofill** the passwords for the common accounts. If the password is reset, your team leader will update it in the vault, saving you the hassle of chasing down the new password.

You can find more information on how to autofill passwords for browsers on this `webpage <https://bitwarden.com/help/auto-fill-browser/>`_.

Multiple Bitwarden accounts
---------------------------

If you are already a Bitwarden user and have an account, it might still prompt you to create a new account. In that case, you can `log in to multiple accounts <https://bitwarden.com/help/cli/#log-in-to-multiple-accounts>`_ and `switch between them <https://bitwarden.com/help/account-switching/>`_.
