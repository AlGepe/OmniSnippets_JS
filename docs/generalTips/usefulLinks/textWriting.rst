Text writing
=====================

The most useful links when writing an article:

 * `Codecogs <https://www.codecogs.com/latex/eqneditor.php>`__ — to generate the maths formula (e.g. if we want to display it in the calculator).
 * `Diffchecker <https://www.diffchecker.com/>`__ — to check the corrections by reviewers and proofreader.
 * `Superscript and subscript generator <https://lingojam.com/TinyTextGenerator>`__ — converts numbers and text to superscripts, subscripts, and small caps. **It works great for digits but only partially good for letters**. You can check the list of available super- and subscripts (and their unicodes) on `Wikipedia   <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_subscripts_and_superscripts>`__. If you can't find a letter, you can use ``<code>`` and ``<sup>``/``<sub>`` tags as alternatives.
 * `Archive.org <https://archive.org/web/>`__ —  Internet Archive's Wayback Machine - potentially useful when you have referenced an online resource once, but now it's gone.
 * `Emojipedia <https://emojipedia.org/>`__ —  emojis' database. You can also check `emojis by year <http://unicode.org/emoji/charts/emoji-versions.html>`__. For compatibility with older phones and operating systems, **choose emojis from 2016 and before**.
 * `Greek letters <https://sciencenotes.org/html-codes-for-greek-letters/>`__ —  capital and small greek letter with their HTML codes.
