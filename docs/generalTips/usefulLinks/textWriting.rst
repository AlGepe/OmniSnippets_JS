Text writing
=====================

The most useful links when writing an article:

* `Codecogs <https://www.codecogs.com/latex/eqneditor.php>`_ — to generate the maths formula (e.g. if we want to display it in the calculator).
* `Diffchecker <https://www.diffchecker.com/>`_ — to check the corrections by reviewers and proofreader.
* `Superscript and subscript generator <https://lingojam.com/TinyTextGenerator>`_ — converts numbers and text to superscripts, subscripts, and small caps. **It works great for digits but only partially good for letters**. You can check the list of available super- and subscripts (and their unicodes) on `Wikipedia   <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_subscripts_and_superscripts>`_. If you can't find a letter, you can use ``<code>`` and ``<sup>``/``<sub>`` tags as alternatives.
* `Archive.org <https://archive.org/web/>`_ —  Internet Archive's Wayback Machine - potentially useful when you have referenced an online resource once, but now it's gone.
* `Emojipedia <https://emojipedia.org/>`_ —  emojis' database. You can also check `emojis by year <http://unicode.org/emoji/charts/emoji-versions.html>`_. For compatibility with older phones and operating systems, **choose emojis from 2016 and before**.
* `Greek letters <https://sciencenotes.org/html-codes-for-greek-letters/>`_ —  capital and small greek letter with their HTML codes.
