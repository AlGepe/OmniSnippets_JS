Omni links
=====================

Here is the list of most useful and most frequently used links:

1. `Omni Common <https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CW8H5OP9cdzvHRyO7IJR2tKHkBD20jUy>`__ (GDrive):
  
   * **Availability** — our working hours. Remember to **fill it regularly**, ideally at least one week in advance, so that we can **better organize our work**. Keep in mind different time zones.
   * **Calculators Mastermind** — the ideas for regular and marketing calculators. Check the :ref:`dedicated Mastermind chapter <mastermind>` for more details.
   * **Omni Team** — a list of all Omni people. You can find **a division into departments, who is who in the team, and read a few words about everyone**. If you aren't there yet, make sure to fill the gap!
   * **Omni Contacts** — a list of Omni people's contacts (e-mail, phone number, and others).
   * **Omni Shared Accounts** — a list of login details for services we use on a daily basis (SEMrush, Grammarly, etc.).

2. Trello:
  
   * `Calculators schedule <https://trello.com/b/LWbrnTAp/2021-calculator-schedule>`_ — every calculatorian has an own tab where we put all the calculators we're working on and the place for reviewing procedure. Read detailed description :ref:`here <reviewingProcedure>`.
   * `Projects <https://trello.com/b/ojD2h9wl/omni-projects>`_ — every project (planned, ongoing, finished) is described here.
