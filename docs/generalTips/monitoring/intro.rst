Monitoring the traffic
=================================================

So you've created your calculator and sent it out on to the internet. End of story right? Well, not quite. It would be nice to know how its doing.

Using the two tools discussed in this section of the Handbook, you can check on how many people are using your calculator with **Google Analytics** (GA), and how they found your calculator with the **Google Search Console** (GSC).

We'll tell you how to use these tools and how **NOT** to use them, so you can make fair, sensible conclusions about how your calculator is doing.
