Leader: Bogna

Celebrity: Alvaro

For better or worse, we now live in the age of social media. And so, Omni needs a social media presence too! Therefore, Alvaro is making ~10 minute videos presenting DIY physics experiments, where our calculators help explain the topic. While the work in this project is mainly done by a small team, if you have any experience in social media management or photography please message one of the leaders. If you have an idea for a cool experiment we can discuss that we also have a calculator for, please use the link below:

You will be asked, however, to watch every video, like it, comment, subscribe and all of that jazz. Also, if you could please forward it to as many people as possible, it would be greatly appreciated (even if that means stealing your Nanâ€™s tablet to watch it using her account).
