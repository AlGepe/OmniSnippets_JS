Leader: Bogna, Alvaro and Marysia

For better or worse, we now live in the age of social media. And so, Omni needs a social media presence too! Therefore, Alvaro is making ~10 minute videos about physics which use our calculators to help solve the problem. While the work in this project is mainly done by a small team, if you have any experience in social media management or photography please message one of the leaders. If you have an idea for a cool experiment we can discuss that we also have a calculator for, please use the link below: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1k0y1pUKRPGDPpJqF0hd-cBfvGzZI1anQdcniyWmUheU/edit#gid=0
