Kick-ass
=====================

Leader: variable, but usually Hania.

We’ve been making calculators here at Omni for a number of years, and our tools have come a long way. We didn’t even use customJS at the beginning! In light of this, some of our older tools are severely lacking in additional features, and we are now able to provide them. So, we need to go back and make them kick-ass! We usually go through a few calculators a week, analyse them as a group to see what improvements the tools need, and then select a very, very, very willing “volunteer” to make these ideas a reality. After the work has been done, usually a week or two depending on the complexity of the tool, the “volunteer” presents their tool to the group, along with any changes to the text that were made (these are primarily updating the “how to use this calculator” sections).
