Speedruns
=====================

Leader: Maciek

We often realise that there is a large gap in the calculators we offer, or that there is a feature that we should all be more versed in. Thatâ€™s where the speed run project comes in, where we **make a bunch of calculators, usually about a similar topic, in a short period of time**.

Youâ€™ll be given a topic, a buddy, and a deadline. While you will be creating the calculator individually, your partner is there for you to talk to, help and motivate through the week.

If you are both stuck on a problem, be it finding a good idea or a particularly troublesome JS segment, message the `#speed-run <https://omnic.slack.com/archives/C0182KHMUMN>`_ channel. That's the purpose of having everyone do the same topic - any issues that you encounter, someone has probably already solved them and can lend a hand! Also, youâ€™ll **get a cool emoji for participating** ðŸ˜‚
