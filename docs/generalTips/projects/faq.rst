FAQ
====================

Leader: Jack

To make our site more **user friendly**, as well as exploit Google to our advantage as much as we can, we’ve now added an **FAQ section** to the bottom of the calculator text page.

These boxes convert the text therein into code that allows it to be used by Google to get gFAQs. After your introduction, you’ll be expected to **add at least four**, but preferably five to six, FAQs to each new calculator. You’ll then be asked to **check how they performed a week after publishing** by searching for your questions on google.

For more information, as well as a general guide on how to write FAQs, check out :ref:`FAQ guide <faqGuide>`. You can also ask any questions in the `#faq-project <https://omnic.slack.com/archives/C01PWUV7GTX>`_ channel on Slack or by messaging Jack directly.
