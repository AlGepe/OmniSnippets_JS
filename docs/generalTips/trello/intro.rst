    Calculators Schedule Trello page

Each calculatorian owns a **personal list** on their respective Power Team board. Every list consists of separate **cards, one for each calculator** or task.

For each sprint, first place cards in the **"To Do"** list for calculators and tasks you plan to do. Then move them to the **"Doing"** list when you are working on them. FInally, move them to the **"Done"** list when you have finished working on them.

.. warning::
  Make sure your cards in the "Done" column properly reflects what you have completed during a sprint before it ends.

.. note::
  Remember â€” Trello information should be always **up to date**.
