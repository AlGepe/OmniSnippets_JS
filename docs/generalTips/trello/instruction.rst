Adding a new calculator
=======================

To add a new calculator to Trello:

1. Find the TEMPLATE card on your Power Team's board, in the **Links & Resources** column.
2. Open the card and click the blue **Create card from template** button, located at the top of the card.
3. Modify the title; remove "TEMPLATE"; replace "SP" with the estimated number of story points; add the calculator's name; and replace "Initials" with your initials, so it's clear you are the author of the calculator. For example, "(5) Percentage [SW]".
4. Choose a list to add it to:
   
   * Your person list for calculators you plan to do someday;
   * The "To Do" list for calculator you are going to do in the current sprint; or
   * The "Doing" list, if you are going to get straight to work on it.

5. Click on the **Create card** button.
6. **Add a supercategory label** to the card â€“ These are grey in color, and you may have to click on **Show more labels** to see them. There are eight labels to choose from:

  * Biology, Chem, Food, Ecology
  * Construct, Conversion, Everyday, Other
  * Finance
  * Finance (wide audience)
  * Health, Sport
  * Health, Sport (wide audience)
  * Math, Stats
  * Physics

  *The two "wide audience" labels are for those calculators that are in the finance, health, and sport categories that are suited to a wide audience, rather than a specialist user.*

7. **Join the card** and start working on your calculator, completing the card's :ref:`checklists<checklist>`.

Once your calculator is ready, it's time to :ref:`send it to review<reviewingProcedure>`.


.. note::
  It's a good practice to **add the calculator's link** (www page) into the card's description. Makes it easier to go directly from Trello to the calculator.
