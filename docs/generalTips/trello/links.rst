.. _links:
Links from previous calculators
=====================

One week after publishing a calculator, you should choose **three of our existing tools** and **add internal links to the new calculator**. 

Sometimes, you can find a suitable phrase to put a link on. Sometimes, you may need to add one or two additional sentences, or modify the existing ones. As a last resort, if you can't find any good connection from older tools, you can write a standard "Check our *[name]* calculator", though try not to overuse this sentence!

When youâ€™re done, mark the additional point on the checklist "add at least 3 links in old calculators" as done, and remove the label from the card.

.. note::
  In general, older calculators have fewer links than the recent ones so consider **choosing at least one or two tools that were published a long time ago**. It'll help us keep **the saturation of internal links comparable** among all our calculators.
