Links from previous calculators
===============================

After your calculator is published, you should choose **at least one (at most three) of our existing tools** and **add internal links to the new calculator**. 

Sometimes, you can find a suitable phrase to put a link on. Sometimes, you may need to add one or two additional sentences, or modify the existing ones. As a last resort, if you can't find any good connection from older tools, you can write a standard "Check our *[name]* calculator", though try not to overuse this sentence!

The procedure to add a link is:

1. Add the :ref:`internal link<linksInternal>`.
2. Save the text.
3. Name the revision "Link added", or something like that.
4. Click the star icon to make the new revision live on the website.

There is **no need to get someone to proofread this change**, unless you have added a lot of text (which isn't require) or you are unsure of something.

When you're done, check off the additional point on the checklist "After publication, **add** 1 to 3 links in old calculators", and remove the pink links label from the card.

.. note::
  In general, older calculators have fewer links than the recent ones, so consider **choosing tools that were published a long time ago** and have fewer than five internal links. It'll help us keep **the saturation of internal links comparable** among all our calculators.

.. tip::
  You **don't need to be the author** of these previous calculators you link from. It could be one of Matt's original calculators. That's fine.
