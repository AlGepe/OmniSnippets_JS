Reviewing procedure (for Calculatorians)
========================================

How to send a calculator to review:

1. **Go through all of the** :ref:`checklists<checklist>` on your calculator card, checking off items that are ready. If you forgot about something, fix it!
2. If you have any **additional remarks**, leave them on the calculator card as **a comment**.
3. In the revisions section of the edit calculator page, :ref:`name the revision <revisionsNameARevision>` you wish your reviewer to assess, "To review" (or include those words).
4. Click the **"First review"** button.

.. note::
  If you've **improved a calculator that had a yellow label**, set the label color to red once again (but **don't use the button "First review"!** again).
