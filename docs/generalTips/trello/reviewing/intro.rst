Reviewing procedure
=================================================

How to send a calculator to review:

1. **Go through the whole checklist** on your calculator card, checking off items that are ready. If you forgot about something, fix it!
2. **Add the reviewer** (usually Ania, Dominik, Steve or Wojtek) to the card with your calculator.
3. Click the "First review" button. 
4. If you have any **additional remarks**, leave them on the calculator card as **a comment**.
5. If you've **improved a calculator that had a yellow label**, set the label color to red once again (don't use the button "First review"!).
