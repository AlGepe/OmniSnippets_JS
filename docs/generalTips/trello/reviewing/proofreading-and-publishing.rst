Proofreading and publishing
===========================

Your reviewer will send your calculator to proofreading (unless they do proofreading too) by **adding the "to proofread" label** to the card.

You may get feedback from your proofreader for issues that occur multiple times, allowing you to learn for your next calculator. To see all of the changes made to your calculator, use the :ref:`revision diff<revisions>` feature.

Your proofreader will **publish** the calculator, and you'll get a new green "published" label.

After the calculator has been published, go ahead and add links to your new calculator from the text of related old calculators. That will allow you to check off the final item on the checklist.
