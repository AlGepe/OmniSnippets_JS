Improving calculator after review
=================================

If there is anything to change or improve in the calculator, the reviewer will **note this in the comment section and set the label to yellow**. You should address all the points, although **you can disagree with the suggestions** â€” remember to leave a comment with an explanation.

If you've improved a calculator that had a yellow label, **set the label color to red once again** (don't use the button *First review*!).

This ping pong game continues until the calculator is polished and ready to proofread and publish.
