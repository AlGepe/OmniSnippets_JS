Date
=====================

The due date on a Trello's card tells about:

* When the calculator was **sent for the review for the first time** (added automatically after selecting *First review* button); or
* When **you should add** :ref:`links <trelloLinks>` **to this calculator** and **check FAQ snippets and questions** :ref:`results <checkResults>` (added by a proofreader). 

You may also set the date manually by clicking *Dates* option on the card.

The dates also help organize calculators chronologically.
