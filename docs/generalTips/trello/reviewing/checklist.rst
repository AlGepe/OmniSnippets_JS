Checklist
=====================

Before sending a calculator to review, make sure to **complete all necessary tasks from the checklist**. By doing so, we ensure that all key elements of a calculator are done.

Most of the tasks are self-explanatory, so here is the list of less obvious ones:

1. **additional text to proofread?** — if you display some text message or the combination of sentences **with customJS**, check this option. You can also mention about all possible calculator outcomes to make proofreaders' lifes easier.
2. **VPN check** — if you're using different default metric and imperial units, check this task. One of possible ways to do so: 
 * Open Opera browser;
 * Go to **incognito mode** (``Ctrl`` + ``Shift`` + ``n``);
 * Click *VPN* button on the search bar;
 * Connect with VPN;
 * If you're using **metric units by default - set US as the virtual location**, if you're using **imperial units by default - set Europe**;
 * Open calculator's web page; and
 * Check if everything works as it should.
3. **FAQ** — add **at least 4** Question-Answer pairs (ideally 5-7) according to the `FAQ guide <https://omnigeneraltips.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generalTips/textStructure/faq/intro.html>`_.
