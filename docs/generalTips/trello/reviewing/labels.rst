Labels
=====================

We use labels to indicate the status of the calculator. Some of the labels may also help you find calculators from a particular project.

    The current labels' colors we use on Trello

These are currently used labels (person who adds):

* **Green** — Published calculator (proofreader);
* **Yellow** — To improve (reviewer if there are any changes or improvements to be made);
* **Orange** — To proofread (reviewer after the final check);
* **Red** — Ready to review (calculatorian, added automatically after selecting the *First review* button or manually after addressing all the changes from the review);
* **Violet** — Kick-Ass Project (calculatorian if the calculator is a part of this project);
* **Blue** — Not published yet (proofreader, this calculator is done and proofread but sometimes we want to postpone the publishing for a specific date);
* **Pale Green** — Speed run (calculatorian if the calculator is a part of this project);
* **Pink** — Add links & FAQ (proofreader; a **week after publishing the tool** the calculatorian adds links **to this new calculator** in at least 3 old, published tools, and **does the FAQs snippets and questions check**);
* **Black** — Under development (calculatorian, optional - e.g., you can distinguish between calculators you're currently working on and the ones you're planning to make in the future).
