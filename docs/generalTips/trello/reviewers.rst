Reviewing procedure (for reviewers)
===================================

This page explains how to find calculators to review, through to submitting them to proofreading.

Looking for new calculators to review
-------------------------------------

Here is the Trello process for reviewing calculators.

1. On the main Trello board, find the list named **"Available to review"**.
2. For each supercategory you have been assigned (see the names on each Dashcard), **look to see if any new calculators that are ready to review** (tip: if the card has a zero ("0") on the front, then there aren't any inside).
3. When choosing a calculator to review, pick the one with the **oldest due date** (or has "URGENT" in its name, or if no due date, oldest creation date). You can quickly see the oldest one by clicking on the Explore button and sorting by the due date. You should **only take one calculator to review at a time** and not reserve lots of calculators to review.
4. Once you have found a calculator that needs reviewing, open it and **join the card**.
5. **Add the label "reviewer added"** to the card (very IMPORTANT!). Doing this takes the calculator out of the "available to review" pool.
6. Look at the calculator and decide if the review can be **skipped**. If the Calculatorian is experienced (has 25+ calculators published) and the calculator is fairly simple (only a few equations, no JS code) or very similar to existing calculators (e.g., animal gestation calculators), then consider skipping the calculator and sending it straight to proofreading.
7. Perform your **first review**, as set out in the :ref:`guide for reviewers<reviewersGuide>` section of this handbook.
8. If improvements are to be made, write a comment for the author, remove the red "ready to review" label, and **add the yellow "to improve" label**.

.. note::
  If when reviewing you feel the calculator is in the **wrong supercategory** (i.e., you think it should be in another category), carry on with the review. This is likely to happen in edge cases, so you should be able to still complete the review. Overall, this effect should even itself out.

The idea is to **share out the workload equally** across each supercategory reviewer team. A good rule of thumb for planning your reviewing work is to divide the number of calculators for review by the size of the reviewer team for a supercategory, then complete that number of reviews in the next session, day or week. And if you know someone is away on holiday, for example, don't include them in that calculation.

In addition, the review coordinator will **monitor the overall progress** of each supercategory review team and advise you if you need to increase the number of calculators you are reviewing.

Checking for improved calculators
---------------------------------

Once a Calculatorian has acted upon the comments of your first review, they will set the card's label back to "ready to review". Revised calculators appear in the **"Improved calculators" list** on the main Trello board.

1. Click on one of your assigned supercategory cards with one or more calculators and find a calculator you have previously reviewed.
2. Check the improvements â€“ has the Calculatorian addressed all of your comments. If further revisions are required, make your comment and set the label back to "to improve".
3. Once you are happy with the calculator, you can send it to be proofread by removing the red "ready to review" label and **adding the orange "to proofread" label**.

.. note::
  If you are also a proofreader and have time now, go straight ahead and proofread the calculator and text. Otherwise, add the "to proofread" label, and either you or another proofreader will pick it up later.

You can also look out for Trello notifications about calculators that are ready to be looked at again.
