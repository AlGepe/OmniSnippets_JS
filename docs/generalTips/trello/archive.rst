Archiving cards
=====================

Once every month, we do a cleanup to keep Trello information transparent â€” namely **archiving Trello**. How is it done?

The Head of Calculatorians, Hania, goes through every list and **archives every card of a calculator that is published and has all the final checks done** (FAQs and links). The card disappears from the schedule.

Nothing special ðŸ˜‰ â€” just make sure all the information is up to date.


.. note::
  You can always come back to your **archived calculators**: *Show menu* â†’ *More* â†’ *Archived items*.
  
.. note::
  If you decide to give up working on any calculator (for whatever reason) you can also **archive the card yourself**. Simply open the card and select the *Archive* button.
