Proofreading procedure
======================

The general goal of proofreading is to catch typos, make sure clear American English (for now, anyway) is used, and to check that the calculator and text are styled correctly.

To remind yourself of Omni's in-house style rules, review these sections of this manual:

* :ref:`textStylingGuide`
* :ref:`calcStylingGuide`
* FAQ guide → :ref:`answers`

You should also quickly check that the calculator is working as expected and that everything is clear to the user – which in this case is you. Omni's calculators should be as straightforward as possible to use and understand. If there is an issue for the author to address, add it to the Trello card and set the label to the **yellow "to improve"** label.

Once the calculator has been honed to perfection, it's time to publish it and update the Trello card.

Publish the calculator
----------------------

Make the correct revision of the calculator the :ref:`live revision <revisionsLiveRevision>`, then use the **Publish** item in the gear icon drop-down menu to publish the calculator. Further details on the publishing process can be found here: :ref:`revisionsPublishingACalculator`.

Update Trello card
------------------

1. Change the card's label from the **orange "to proofread"** label, to the **green "published"** label.
2. Click on the **"FAQ-links" button**, which can be found under the **"Automation" section** on the right of Trello card.
   
   This will add a link to the FAQ performance tracking spreadsheet and add a task to the checklist to add links to this calculator from three existing calculators.
3. Add a comment to the card saying you've **proofread and published** the calculator. Add any other comments you think the author might benefit from for future calculators.

.. tip::
  Always choose the Trello card with the **oldest date** to proofread next.
